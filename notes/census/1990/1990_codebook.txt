         CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING, 1990 [UNITED STATES]: PUBLIC         
    USE MICRODATA SAMPLE: 5-PERCENT SAMPLE (ICPSR 9952)                         
                                                                                
                                                                                
    SUMMARY: The Public Use Microdata Sample  (PUMS)  5-Percent  Sample         
    contains household and person records for a sample of housing units         
    that received the "long form" of  the  1990  Census  questionnaire.         
    Data   items  cover  the  full  range  of  population  and  housing         
    information collected in the 1990 Census, including 500  occupation         
    categories,  age  by single years up to 90, and wages in dollars up         
    to $140,000. Each person identified in the sample has an associated         
    household    record,    containing    information    on   household         
    characteristics such as type of household and family income.                
                                                                                
                                                                                
    UNIVERSE: All persons and housing units in the United States.               
                                                                                
                                                                                
    SAMPLING: A stratified sample, consisting of a  sub-sample  of  the         
    household   units   that   received  the  1990  Census  "long-form"         
    questionnaire (approximately 15.9 percent of all housing units).            
                                                                                
                                                                                
    NOTE: (1) All PUMS files  were  resupplied  by  the  Census  Bureau         
    during  the  summer of 1993 and Group Quarters data were resupplied         
    in 1996.  ICPSR has incorporated  extensive  user  notes  into  the         
    machine-readable  codebook.  PUMA maps, Appendix G of the codebook,         
    are being released on a flow basis by the Census Bureau. These  are         
    available in hardcopy form from ICPSR. (2) Although all records are         
    231 characters in length, each file is hierarchical  in  structure,         
    containing  a  housing unit record followed by a variable number of         
    person  records.  Both  record  types  contain  approximately   120         
    variables.  Two  improvements  over  the  1980 PUMS files have been         
    incorporated. First, the housing unit serial number  is  identified         
    on  both the housing unit record and on the person record, allowing         
    the file to be processed as a rectangular file. In  addition,  each         
    person  record  is assigned an individual weight, allowing users to         
    more closely approximate published reports. Unlike previous  years,         
    the  1990  PUMS  1-Percent  and  5-Percent  Samples  have  not been         
    released in separate geographic series (known  as  "A,"  "B,"  etc.         
    records).  Instead,  each  sample  has  its own set of geographies,         
    known as "Public Use Microdata Areas" (PUMAs), established  by  the         
    Census  Bureau  with  assistance  from  each State Data Center. The         
    PUMAs in the 5-Percent Sample are  based  on  counties  and  places         
    within  states.  Each PUMA is a county or place, or groups thereof,

            Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) contain records                 
    representing 5% or 1% samples of the housing units in the U.S. and          
    the persons in them.  Selected group quarters persons are also              
    included.  The file contains individual weights for each person and         
    housing unit which, when applied to the individual records, expand          
    the sample to the total population.  Most population and housing            
    items are listed below.  Please see the Data Dictionary for a               
    complete listing of variables and recodes.  Both the 5% and 1%              
    samples have the same subject content and vary only in geographic           
    composition of the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA).  A 3% elderly          
    sample will be available later.

            Each PUMS file provides records for States and many of their        
    geographic levels.  The hierarchy is shown below: The 5% sample             
    identifies every State and various subdivisions of States called            
    "Public Use Microdata Areas", each with at least 100,000 persons.           
    These PUMAs were primarily based on counties, and may be whole              
    counties, groups of counties, and places.  When these entities have         
    more than 200,000 persons, PUMAs can represent parts of counties,           
    places, etc.  None of these PUMAs on the 5% sample crosses state            
    lines.                                                                      
            On the other hand, the 1% sample was based primarily on             
    metropolitan/nonmetropolitan areas, and contains PUMAs which were           
    made from whole central cities, whole MSAs or PMSAs, MSA or PMSAs           
    outside the central city, groups of MSAs or PMSAs, and groups of            
    areas outside MSAs or PMSAs.  When the areas have more than 200,000         
    persons, 1% PUMAs can represent parts of central cities, MSA/PMSAs,         
    and so forth.  1% PUMAs may cross State lines and in that case State        
    codes are not shown.  See examples of PUMAs in figures 2-4.

            Since individual weights are provided on PUMS, most estimates       
    derived from PUMS tabulations can be checked for reasonableness             
    against other 1990 printed reports, STF's or microfiche produced from       
    sample data.

    sample data from summary tape products STF 3 and STF 4 which may be         
    used to verify estimates provided from PUMS files.  These reports

    dummy housing record and a person record.                                   
                                                                                
            The 5% (A) sample includes a separate file for each state.          
    The 1% (B) sample includes a file for each State and a file                 
    containing PUMAs which cross State lines.  The 3% (O) sample (elderly       
    file) has the same geographic composition as the 5% sample, (but            
    includes housing units with at least one person age 60 and over or          
    group quarters persons age 60 and over.)                                    
                                                                                
            The block size for the files varies with each user's                
    specifications, however the standard block size is 32,340 characters        
    for 1990 PUMS.

            The 1990 Public Use microdata files are a special type of           
    nonrectangular file-hierarchical.  That is, the file contains several       
    record types each with different variables, rather than one gigantic        
    record with all the variables.  We release the PUMS in this format          
    because of the tremendous amount of data contained in one record.

    The file is sorted to maintain the relationship between both record         
    types.                                                                      
                                                                                
            Although these records are extremely large they can be              
    handled by most statistical or report writing software.  There are          
    two basic record types: the housing unit record and the person              
    record.  For 1990, each of the records contains a serial number which       
    links the persons in the housing unit to the proper housing unit            
    record, so that a user no longer needs to worry about keeping the           
    record sequence as the file was delivered.                                  
                                                                                
            In today's information processing environment, most standard        
    statistical software packages are now capable of handling the file in       
    either format: hierarchical or rectangular structure.  Most software        
    packages, such as SAS, SPSS, BMDP, and some relational data base            
    systems, will in fact rectangularize hierarchical files.  Further,          
    the manuals accompanying most packages contain samples of code              
    showing how to process the files.  Several of the packages also have        
    extract procedures already coded into the software.                         
                                                                                
            The 1990 PUMS will be accompanied by electronic data                
    dictionaries in a format which will allow the user to read in ASCII         
    characters and prepare statements transforming the variables and            
    their corresponding descriptions and values to the proper statements        
    required by the software package of choice.                                 
                                                                                
            The files will be ASCII, with no special software appended,         
    so as to be compatible with most software packages.  But the                
    technical documentation will include a section on "how to use this          
    file", where software concerns will be addressed.  The user must be         
    familiar with the processing system's limitations and the efficiency        
    of the procedures within the software packages.                             
                                                                                
            Users may also write their own code enabling them to perform

    Public-use microdata samples are computer accessible files which            
    contain records for a sample of housing units, with information on          
    the characteristics of each unit and the people in it.  We exclude          
    information which would identify a household or an individual in            
    order to protect the confidentiality of respondents.  Within the            
    limits of the sample size and geographic detail, these files allow          
    users to prepare virtually any tabulations they require.                    
                                                                                
    Separate public-use microdata samples are available, each

    We provide computer accessible data products in several formats as          
    summary data or as microdata.  Summary data are the type of data            
    found in census printed reports, summary tape files, microfiche, and        
    most special tabulations; microdata are the information collected           
    from each person and housing unit on the questionnaire.                     
                                                                                
    In summary data, the basic unit of analysis is a specific geographic        
    area (for example, a census tract, county or State) for which counts        
    of persons or housing units (or aggregated data) in particular              
    categories are provided.  In microdata, the basic unit is an                
    individual housing unit and the persons who live in it.  Figure 1           
    illustrates the basic distinctions between summary data and                 
    microdata.                                                                  
                                                                                
    Often, there are two types of microdata: Confidential microdata             
    include the census basic record types, computerized versions of the         
    questionnaires collected from households, as coded and edited during        
    census processing.  The Census Bureau tabulates these confidential          
    microdata in order to produce the summary data that go into the             
    various reports, summary tape files (STFs), and special tabulations.        
                                                                                
    Public-use microdata samples are extracts from the confidential

    microdata taken in a manner that avoids disclosure of information           
    about identifiable households or individuals.                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
    PROTECTING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION                                         
                                                                                
    All data released (in print or electronic media) by the Bureau of the       
    Census are subject to strict confidentiality measures imposed by the        
    legislation under which our data are collected: Title 13, U.S. Codes        
    which protects the confidentiality of individual respondents.               
    Responses to the questionnaire can be used only for statistical             
    purposes, and Census Bureau employees are sworn to protect                  
    respondents' identities.                                                    
                                                                                
    Records on public-use microdata samples are selected after the              
    confidentiality edit is performed, and contain no names or addresses.       
    Also, the Bureau limits the detail (topcodes, recodes) on place of          
    residence, place of work, high incomes, and other selected items to         
    further protect the confidentiality of the records.                         
                                                                                
    Microdata records identify no geographic area with fewer than 100,000       
    inhabitants.  Microdata samples include only a small fraction of the        
    population, drastically limiting the chance that the record of a            
    given individual is even contained in a public-use microdata file,          
    much less identifiable.                                                     
                                                                                
                                                                                
    USES OF MICRODATA FILES                                                     
                                                                                
    Public-use microdata files essentially make possible "do-it-yourself"       
    special tabulations.  Since the 1990 files furnish nearly all of the        
    detail recorded on long-form questionnaires in the census, subject to       
    the limitations of sample size and geographic identification, users         
    can construct an infinite variety of tabulations interrelating any          
    desired set of variables. Users have the same freedom to manipulate         
    the data that they would have if they had collected the data in their       
    own sample survey, yet these files offer the precision of census data       
    collection techniques and sample sizes larger than would be feasible        
    in most independent sample surveys.                                         
                                                                                
    Microdata samples will be useful to users (1) who are doing research        
    that does not require the identification of specific small geographic       
    areas or detailed cross tabulations for small populations, and (2)          
    who have access to programming and computer time needed to process          
    the samples.  Microdata users frequently study relationships among          
    census variables not shown in existing census tabulations, or               
    concentrate on the characteristics of certain specially defined             
    populations, such as unemployed homeowners or families with four or         
    more children.

    SAMPLE DESIGN AND SIZE                                                      
                                                                                
    Each microdata file is a stratified sample of the population,               
    actually a subsample of the full census sample (approximately 15.9%         
    of all housing units) that received census long-form questionnaires.        
    Sampling was done housing unit-by-housing unit in order to allow            
    study of family relationships and housing unit characteristics.             
    Sampling of persons in institutions and other group quarters was done       
    on a person-by-person basis.  Vacant units were sampled also.               
                                                                                
    There are two independently drawn samples, designated "5% (A)" and          
    "1% (B),", each featuring a different geographic scheme, as discussed       
    below.  Samples from the 1970 and 1960 censuses also employed a 1%          
    sample size, the 5% sample was new for 1980.  Nationwide, the 1990 5%       
    Sample gives the user records for over 12 million persons and over 5        
    million housing units.  On the other hand, since processing a smaller       
    sample is less expensive, some users will want to produce extracts          
    using the subsample numbers provided in the housing record.  Sample         
    design is discussed more thoroughly in chapter 4.                           
                                                                                
    Unlike 1980, each file contains individual weights for both the             
    housing unit and the persons in the unit.  The user can estimate the        
    frequency of a particular characteristic for the entire population by       
    summing the weight variables for records with that characteristic           
    from the microdata file.  A section of Chapter 4 discusses the              
    preparation and verification of estimates (see page 4-1).                   
                                                                                
    Reliability improves with increases in sample size, so the choice of        
    sample size must represent a balance between the level of precision         
    desired and the resources available for working with microdata files.       
    By using tables provided in chapter 3 (see page 3-2), one can               
    estimate the degree to which sampling error will affect any specific        
    estimate prepared from a microdata file of a particular sample size.        
                                                                                
    Many factors affect the user's decision on which file to use.  Users        
    of microdata files for State or MSA estimates would normally use a 1%       
    or 5% sample, while users concerned only with national figures can          
    frequently get by with a smaller sample, say a 0.1-percent                  
    (one-in-a-thousand) sample.  Although we no longer provide the 0.1%         
    file we do provide subsample numbers which allow scientifically             
    designed extracts of various sizes to be drawn.  Even national users        
    may need a 1% or a 5% sample if extremely detailed tabulations are          
    needed, or if users are concerned with very small segments of the           
    population, for example, females 75 years old or over of Italian            
    ancestry.                                                                   
                                                                                
    One of the examples in chapter 3 discusses the selection of the             
    appropriate sample size for a particular study.

    Microdata files contain the full range of population and housing            
    information collected in the 1990 census: 500 occupation categories,        
    age by single years up to 90, wages in dollars up to $140,000, and so       
    forth.  Because the samples provide data for all persons living in a        
    sampled household, users can study how characteristics of household         
    members are interrelated (for example, income and educational               
    attainment of husbands and wives).                                          
                                                                                
    Information for each housing unit in the sample appears on a                
    231-character record with geographic and housing items, followed by a       
    variable number of 231-character records with person's information,         
    one record for each member of the household.  Items on the housing          
    record are listed beginning on page 5-1; items on the persons record        
    are listed beginning on page 5-4.  Although each of the items as            
    collected is further defined in the glossary (reprinted from the 1990       
    Census Users' Guide) presented as appendix B to this document, it is        
    important to note that we modified several items on the microdata           
    file to provide protection for individual respondents.  We also             
    include many transformed variables (recodes), such as those appearing       
    on the STF 3A files, so that users can analyze many complex                 
    relationships between records.  Data users will frequently want to          
    generate additional variables or develop recodes to meet their              
    individual needs.                                                           
                                                                                
    While it is impossible to predict all the transformations (recodes)         
    required by data users, we included many of the more common ones            
    (household income, selected monthly owner costs, poverty status, and        
    so forth).  Transformations such as these, as well as corrections           
    that apply to certain subjects, are discussed in appendix C.                
                                                                                
    We edited the sample questionnaires for completeness and consistency,       
    and made substitutions or allocations for any missing data.                 
    Allocation flags appear at the end of each record indicating each           
    item which has been allocated.  Thus, a user desiring to tabulate           
    only actually observed values can eliminate variables with allocated        
    values.  Editing and allocation flags are discussed beginning on page       
    3-15.

    * Public-use microdata samples do not actually contain alphabetic           
      information.  Such information is converted to numeric codes; for         
      example, the State of Virginia has a numeric code of 51.                  
                                                                                
                                                                                
    GEOGRAPHIC IDENTIFICATION                                                   
                                                                                
            The 5% and 1% Samples each feature a different geographic           
    scheme: We call the geographic areas PUMAs for Public Use Microdata         
    Areas.  We use the term to apply to each of the areas identified on         
    these files.  A 5-digit number, unique within State, identifies each        
    PUMA.  The first three digits is the PUMA code and the last two are         
    the sub-PUMA.  The sub-PUMA is used when counties or metropolitan           
    areas are subdivided by groupings of census tracts.  For example, the       
    PUMAs for Bronx County, New York consist of several groups of census        
    tracts numbered from 05101 through 05111, whereas the PUMA numbered         
    03500 is made up of 3 counties: Courtland, Tioga and Tompkins Co.           
                                                                                
            The State Data Center provided the PUMAs for most states.           
    For the states of Georgia, Indiana, and Oregon, the Census Bureau           
    developed the PUMAs with input from the respective State Data Center.       
                                                                                
    o         The 5% Sample identifies every State, most                        
              individual counties or county equivalents with                    
              100,000 or more inhabitants, many individual cities

              inhabitants, and for counties with at least 200,000               
              inhabitants groupings of Census tracts are also                   
              identified.                                                       
                                                                                
              Areas  with populations under 100,000 have been                   
              grouped into reasonable analytic units often                      
              equivalent to State planning district boundaries.  In             
              New England, areas are defined in terms of cities                 
              and towns rather than counties.

              The 1% Sample identifies MAs of 100,000 or more                   
              inhabitants.  The remaining MAs are paired                        
              together so that metropolitan and nonmetropolitan                 
              territory can be separately analyzed.                             
                                                                                
              Many large cities, groups of cities, and counties are             
              identified within large MAs.  Outside MAs, counties               
              are grouped according to State planning districts or              
              into other reasonable analytic units with populations             
              of 100,000 or more.                                               
                                                                                
              On the 1% sample, when PUMAs cross state                          
              boundaries, states are not separately identified. All             
              of these records appear on a separate file where the              
              state is identified as "99".  (See Appendix G).                   
                                                                                
            The characteristics of the different geographic schemes are         
    compared in the maps and charts which follow in figures 2, 3, and 4.        
                                                                                
            Purchasers of the 1% Sample for any of the States which             
    include area in a county group crossing State lines may want to             
    request that the "State Code 99" file be stacked onto a tape being          
    purchased.  Estimates of the number of tapes required for specified         
    groups of files at a given density and blocking factor are available        
    on request from Customer Services.                                          
                                                                                
            At the time of this printing, we have not produced files for        
    all States, and estimates of the number of tapes required for               
    specified groups of files at a given density and blocking factor are        
    available on request from Customer Services.  We will issue a user          
    note updating this information when all files are produced.                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
    CORRESPONDING MICRODATA FROM EARLIER CENSUSES                               
                                                                                
            PUMS files exist for the 1960, 1970 and 1980 censuses.  Very        
    little comparability exists between geographic identifiers on each of       
    the previous files, but housing and population characteristics are          
    similar.  And because of this similarity, microdata files from the          
    most recent censuses are a rich resource for analysis of trends.            
    Items which were added, dropped, or substantially changed between           
    1980 and 1990 are listed in figure 5.  Appendix B discusses

            This chapter serves as a guide for data users to both the           
    tape and the technical documentation.  Novice users trying to               
    understand how to use the documentation and the file should read this       
    chapter first.                                                              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    DOCUMENTATION CHAPTERS                                                      
                                                                                
            The Abstract chapter in this documentation provides a quick         
    overview of the file, including the formal title, geographic                
    coverage, subject coverage, and file availability.  Also shown are          
    citations for related reference materials and printed reports.  Their       
    titles and geography are included in this section, along with               
    purchasing information.                                                     
                                                                                
            Chapter 1 describes microdata, chapter 3 describes accuracy         
    of the data, and chapter 4 describes the sample design and estimation       
    for PUMS.                                                                   
                                                                                
                                                                                
    USER NOTES                                                                  
                                                                                
            Information about file or documentation changes sometimes           
    becomes available after the documentation has been printed.  User           
    notes inform the user community about these changes.  These are             
    issued in a numbered series.  If there are technical documentation          
    changes, revised pages usually accompany them.  The revised pages           
    should be inserted in their proper location, but the user note cover        
    sheet should be filed in the User Notes chapter.  Technical notes,          
    which contain file errata, are also issued by the Census Bureau.  We        
    suggest filing these following appendix I.                                  
                                                                                
                                                                                
    DATA DICTIONARY                                                             
                                                                                
            The data dictionary (code book) describes the file and              
    provides character locations for each variable.

    products of the 1990 census, as well as suggested sources of                
    information and assistance.  Map information is included in appendix        
    G (to be supplied as user notes).  The record layout for the                
    machine-readable data dictionary file that accompanies each tape

            Appendix I contains the code lists used in processing the           
    data for most sample products.  These are especially helpful in             
    determining the components included in categories such as race, and         
    group quarters.  On the PUMS, the information on these lists may be         
    changed for disclosure protection purposes.  Those changes are              
    indicated in the data dictionary and further explained in appendix C.

            Tape orders which specify labeled tapes will have a standard        
    American National Standards Institute (ANSI) label.  The system label       
    consists of 17 characters, but only the first 12 are active.  The           
    remaining five characters will be 'x' filled.  The 1990 PUMS files          
    have a Data Set Name (DSN) of PUMStXss.Fnnxxxxx where t is A, B, or O       
    depending on the file, ss is the United States Postal Service (USPS)        
    State abbreviation, and nn is a two-digit number with leading zeroes        
    identifying the tape volume sequence.  (The "X", "F", and "x" in the        
    DSN remain constant).

            Each user tape will have two user header labels and two user        
    trailer labels.  These labels combine information from the system           
    label and the identification portion of the first and last record.          
    These labels enable the user to quickly identify the beginning and          
    ending records on each tape.

            The user header labels are designated UHL1 and UHL2.  UHL1

            State-specific file information, such as record counts, is          
    not provided in the technical documentation.  However, each tape            
    order is accompanied by a tape creation sheet.  This sheet provides         
    the file name, file label (HDR1), record size, block size, and record       
    count.                                                                      
                                                                                
    The tape creation sheet received with the tape should be filed in the       
    technical documentation notebook or with other tape information             
    maintained by the user.                                                     
                                                                                
                                                                                
    FILE STRUCTURE                                                              
                                                                                
    Each file consists of a series of 231-character logical records of          
    two types; housing and persons.  Each housing unit record is followed       
    by a variable number of person records, one for each member of the          
    housing unit or none if vacant, as illustrated in figure 1.  Each           
    person in group quarters has two records--a dummy "housing unit"            
    record (most nongeographic fields are not applicable), as well as a         
    person record.  For 1990, we made several improvements to the file to       
    aid in processing the data.  Two improvements allowing users more           
    processing flexibility are the inclusion of the housing unit serial         
    number on both record types and the inclusion of individual weights         
    on each record.  Including the housing unit serial number on both           
    records affords the user an option as to how to process the                 
    data-either rectangularly or hierarchically.  With the introduction         
    of individual weights, users can more closely approximate published         
    data.  Another improvement for 1990 is providing many of the recodes        
    (data transformations) which appear on the summary tape file (STF           
    3A).  While the changes increase the file size, we should see an            
    associative increase in file utility.                                       
                                                                                
    In the text of this document, the numeric identification of a               
    particular data item is the same as its character location within a         
    record.  Items on the housing record are prefixed with an H, items on       
    the person record with a P.  For instance, Race, item P12-14, is a          
    two-digit code beginning in character 12 of the person record.  We          
    continue to provide in the data dictionary, or record layout,               
    mnemonic identifiers, many of which are the same as those used in           
    1980. Geographic identifiers and subsample identifiers appear only on       
    the housing unit record.  Thus, most tabulations of person                  
    characteristics require manipulation of both housing and person             
    records.  An item on the housing record indicates the exact number of       
    person records following before the next housing record (PERSONS).          
    This feature allows a program to anticipate what type of record will        
    appear next, if necessary.

    In today's data manipulation environment, users have many options for       
    processing data and are limited only by the amount and type of              
    resources.  Most statistical software packages (e.g. BMDP, SAS, SPSS,       
    to name a few) are capable of handling the data either hierarchically       
    or rectangularly.  Many users may still want to create extract files        
    with any desired household data repeated with each person's record.         
    Users with limited resources (funds, personnel, software/hardware)          
    may want to create or obtain extracts containing only those variables       
    of interest.  All fields are numeric, except for the Record Type            
    which are "H" and "P."

    Every file purchased from the Census Bureau includes a printout             
    showing the total record count.  Estimated file sizes are not shown         
    now, but in a future user note record counts for each state will be         
    identified.

    We release these files on a state-by-state basis.  Records on these         
    files are sorted by geographic area within state.  On the 5% and 1%         
    Samples, all households sampled within a particular PUMA appear             
    together.  PUMAs are sequenced in ascending order within State.  On         
    the 1% Sample, this means that all PUMAs with State code suppressed         
    (i.e., shown as 99) appear on a separate file.  In order to provide         
    an extra measure of protection from disclosure of individual                
    households within each geographic area, we scramble the records to          
    avoid any implication of geographic information beyond that which           
    meets Census Bureau disclosure rules for the 1990 PUMS.  Person             
    records within household are sequenced by relationship code (P2).           
    The householder record always immediately follows the housing unit          
    record for an occupied unit.  This feature simplifies tabulation of         
    households or families by race of householder, ancestry of                  
    householder, and even poverty status--since the desired indicators          
    are always on the first person record.  Where the household contains        
    more than one person of a given relationship, person records appear         
    in sequence of decreasing age (P8-9).                                       
                                                                                
    Persons sampled from within the same group quarters are not                 
    identifiable as such, since each has an independent dummy housing           
    unit record.                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
    MACHINE-READABLE DOCUMENTATION                                              
                                                                                
    Every file includes a machine readable "data dictionary" or record          
    layout.  Irrespective of the PUMS sample used, the record layout is         
    the same.  A user can produce hard copy documentation for extract

    files or labels for tabulations created; or with minor modifications,       
    can use the data dictionary file with software packages or user             
    programs to automatically specify the layout of the microdata files.        
    Also available in machine-readable form is the PUMA Equivalency File,       
    which lists the geographic components (counties or MCDs, places,            
    tracts where available) and their assigned PUMA codes for the 5% and        
    1% samples.                                                                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
    HANDLING INVALID CODES                                                      
                                                                                
    The data dictionary shows each category as having a unique                  
    representation.  Although we reviewed test files for several states,        
    we may have a small number of cases outside the specified range for a       
    variable.  We will correct these errors when found, but users may           
    follow the standard census practice to assign invalid codes to the          
    next lower numbered valid category.  For example, on an allocation          
    flag with valid codes 0, 2 and 3, a 1 would be counted with code 0,         
    and a code of 4 or more would be counted with 3.  Exceptions to this        
    rule occur in occupation and industry codes, where invalid codes are        
    assigned to the next higher valid category.                                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
    PREPARING AND VERIFYING TABULATIONS                                         
                                                                                
    Estimation of totals - Estimates of complete-count census figures may       
    be made from tabulations of public use microdata samples by using a         
    simple inflation estimate - that is, summing the weights associated         
    with that variable; (e.g.  for housing characteristics, use the             
    housing unit weight; for persons characteristics, use the person            
    weight.)  Those users using subsample numbers to vary the sample size       
    must apply an appropriate factor, or, otherwise adjust the weights to       
    derive an appropriate estimation of totals.  We further explain the         
    use of weights and subsample numbers in Chapter 4.                          
                                                                                
    Estimation of percentages - a user can estimate percentages by simply       
    dividing the weighted estimate of persons or housing units with a           
    given characteristic by the weighted sample estimate for the base.          
    Normally, this yields the same as would be obtained if one made the         
    computation using sample tallies rather than weighted estimates.  For       
    example, the percentage of housing units with air conditioning in a         
    one-in-one-hundred sample can be obtained by simply dividing the            
    tally of sample housing units with air conditioning by the total            
    number of sample housing units.                                             
                                                                                
    Verifying tabulations - Producing desired estimates from the                
    public-use microdata samples is relatively easy.  File structure and        
    coding of items is straightforward.  There are no missing data (see         
    the section on allocations, page 3-38).  Records not applicable for         
    each item are assigned to specific "NA" categories, and it is               
    frequently not necessary to determine in a separate operation whether       
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      Page 24                                           ICPSR 9952              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    a record is in the universe or not.  PUMs "universe" and "variable"         
    definitions may differ from other products produced from sample data        
    primarily because of concerns about disclosure risks (e.g.  PUMs            
    files may have different topcodes from STF 3A, or the recodes may           
    vary because the components were topcoded).  A user must, however,          
    anticipate the possibility of errors in his or her own processing.          
    Thus, user tabulations should be verified against other available           
    tallies.  Two ways for the user to verify estimates follow:                 
                                                                                
    1.      Using control tabulations from the samples.                         
            As each public-use microdata sample was                             
            produced, counts of persons, housing units,                         
            vacant housing units, and group quarters                            
            persons selected into the sample were                               
            tallied within each identified geographic                           
            area.  These control counts will be                                 
            published as a supplement to this                                   
            documentation.  (In the interim, counts for                         
            specific areas may be requested from                                
            Customer Services.)  If users cannot                                
            replicate these exact counts, review of the                         
            user's programs, and the shipping advices                           
            accompanying the files are in order.                                
                                                                                
    2.      Using published data from the 1990                                  
            censuses. Tabulations from the 1990 census                          
            data base are available in the printed                              
            census publications and on summary tape                             
            files.  Users may check the reasonableness                          
            of statistics derived from public-use                               
            microdata samples against these sources. A                          
            familiarity with summary data already                               
            available may also facilitate planning of                           
            tabulations to be made from microdata.                              
            Those publications series likely to be of                           
            greatest use for this purpose are listed in                         
            Figure 5.  In comparing sample tabulations                          
            with published data one must carefully note                         
            the universe of the published tabulation.                           
            For instance, on microdata records,                                 
            Industry (P87-89) is reported for the                               
            civilian labor force and for persons not in                         
            the labor force who reported having                                 
            worked in 1985 or later.  Industry                                  
            tabulations in 1990 census publications are                         
            presented only for the employed population                          
            or the experienced civilian labor force.                            
            Thus, a tally of Industry for all persons                           
            from whom industry is reported in                                   
            microdata records would not correspond                              
            directly to any published tabulation.  "A

            user should always pay particular                                   
            attention to concept definitions as                                 
            presented in the glossary."  One cannot, of                         
            course, expect exact agreement between                              
            census publications which are based on the                          
            complete census count, full sample                                  
            estimates, or a subsample of the census                             
            sample and user estimates based on tallies                          
            of a 5-percent or smaller sample.  They will                        
            inevitably differ to some extent due to                             
            chance in selection of actual cases for                             
            Public Use Microdata Samples.  Since the                            
            amount of likely chance variation for a                             
            given statistic can be measured, any                                
            discrepancy beyond a certain level can be                           
            identified as a likely error in programming.                        
            Chapter 3 discusses sampling variability                            
            and its measurement.  User experience has                           
            indicated that careful verification of sample                       
            tabulations is essential -- so important that                       
            it may frequently be advisable to include

    Most of the items for 1990 are comparable to 1980.  Several items           
    found in 1980 PUMS are not in the 1990 file primarily because the           
    inquiries were not asked or because we are providing a measure of           
    protection for respondents.  Full descriptions of item comparability        
    are given in appendix B.  However, users should read appendix C for         
    differences in PUMS definitions and those of other census products.

    CHAPTER 3 - ACCURACY OF THE MICRODATA SAMPLE ESTIMATES                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
    INTRODUCTION                                                                
                                                                                
            The tabulations prepared from a public use microdata sample         
    are based on a subset of the 1990 Census sample.  The data summarized       
    from this file are estimates of the actual figures that would have          
    been obtained from a 100-percent enumeration.  Estimates derived from       
    this sample are expected to be different from the 100-percent figures       
    because they are subject to sampling and nonsampling errors.                
    Sampling error in data arises from the selection of persons and             
    housing units to be included in the sample.  Nonsampling error              
    affects both sample and 100 percent data.  Errors are introduced            
    during the collection and processing phases of the census.  A more          
    detailed discussion of both sampling and nonsampling error is given         
    below.                                                                      
                                                                                
            In microdata samples, the basic unit is an individual housing       
    unit and the persons who live in occupied housing units or group            
    quarters.  However, microdata records in these samples do not contain       
    names or addresses.  A more detailed discussion of methods to protect       
    confidentiality of individual responses follows.                            
                                                                                
                                                                                
    CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE DATA                                                 
                                                                                
            To maintain the confidentiality required by law (Title 13,          
    United States Code), the Bureau of the Census applies a                     
    confidentiality edit to the 1990 census data to assure that published       
    data do not disclose information about specific individuals,                
    households, or housing units.  As a result, a small amount of               
    uncertainty is introduced into the estimates of census                      
    characteristics.  The sample itself provides adequate protection for        
    most areas for which sample data are published since the resulting          
    data are estimates of the actual counts; however, small areas require       
    more protection.  The edit is controlled so that the basic structure        
    of the data are preserved.                                                  
                                                                                
            The confidentiality edit is implemented by selecting a small        
    subset of individual households from the internal sample data files         
    and blanking a subset of the data items on these household records.         
    Responses to those data items were then imputed using the same              
    imputation procedures that were used for nonresponse.  A larger             
    subset of households is selected for the confidentiality edit for           
    small areas to provide greater protection for these areas.  The             
    editing process is implemented in such a way that the quality and           
    usefulness of the data were preserved.                                      
                                                                                
            Since microdata records are the actual housing unit and             
    person records, the Bureau of the Census takes further steps to

    prevent the identification of specific individuals, households, or          
    housing units.                                                              
                                                                                
            The main disclosure avoidance method used is to limit the           
    geographic detail shown in the files.  A geographic area must have a        
    minimum of 100,000 population to be fully identified.  Furthermore,         
    certain variables are topcoded, or the actual value of the                  
    characteristics is replaced by a descriptive statistic, such as the         
    median.                                                                     
                                                                                
                                                                                
    SOURCES OF ERRORS IN THE DATA                                               
                                                                                
            Since the estimates that users produce are based on a sample,       
    they may differ somewhat from 100-percent figures that would have           
    been obtained if all housing units, persons within those housing            
    units, and persons living in group quarters had been enumerated using       
    the same questionnaires, instructions, enumerators, and so forth.           
    The sample estimate also would differ from other samples of housing         
    units, persons within those housing units, and persons living in            
    group quarters.  The deviation of a sample estimate from the average        
    of all possible samples is called the sampling error.  The standard         
    error of a sample estimate is a measure of the variation among the          
    estimates from all the possible samples, and thus, is a measure of          
    the precision with which an estimate from a particular sample               
    approximates the average result of all possible samples.  The sample        
    estimate and its estimated standard error permit the construction of        
    interval estimates with prescribed confidence that the interval             
    includes the average result of all samples.  The method of                  
    calculating standard errors and confidence intervals for the data in        
    the microdata samples, is described in the next section.                    
                                                                                
            In addition to the variability which arises from the sampling       
    procedures, both sample data and 100-percent data are subject to            
    nonsampling error.  Nonsampling error may be introduced during any of       
    the various complex operations used to collect and process census           
    data.  For example, operations such as editing, reviewing, or               
    handling questionnaires may introduce error into the data.  A               
    detailed discussion of the sources of nonsampling error is given in         
    the section on "Control of Nonsampling Error" in this chapter.              
                                                                                
            Nonsampling error may affect the data in two ways.  Errors          
    OAthat are introduced randomly will increase the variability of the         
    data and should, therefore, be reflected in the standard error.             
    Errors that tend to be consistent in one direction will make both           
    sample and 100-percent data biased in that direction.  For example,         
    if respondents consistently tend to underreport their income, then          
    the resulting counts of households or families by income category           
    will tend to be understated for the higher income categories and            
    overstated for the lower income categories.  Such biases are not            
    reflected in the standard error.

    CALCULATIONS OF STANDARD ERRORS USING TABLES                                
                                                                                
            A standard sampling theory text should be helpful if the user       
    needs more information about confidence intervals and nonsampling           
    errors.                                                                     
                                                                                
            Two methods for estimating standard errors of estimated             
    totals and percentages are described in this section.  The first            
    method is very simple.  This method uses already calculated standard        
    errors for specific sizes of estimated totals and percentages given         
    in tables A through F, shown later in this section.  The estimated          
    standard errors shown in tables A through F were calculated assuming        
    simple random sampling while the microdata sample (and the census           
    sample) were selected using a systematic sampling procedure.  The           
    numbers shown in table G, referred to as design factors, are defined        
    as the ratio of the standard error from the actual sample design to         
    the standard error from a simple random sample.                             
                                                                                
            The standard errors in tables A through F used in conjunction       
    with the appropriate design factors from table G produce a reasonable       
    measure of reliability for microdata sample estimates.  Public use          
    microdata sample data users will receive table G, the Table of Design       
    Factors, as a supplement to the technical documentation.  An                
    alternative methodology by which more precise standard errors can be        
    obtained requires additional data processing and file manipulation.         
    The trade off is more precision for more data processing.  However,         
    with the technology available today, the second method is preferable        
    and strongly recommended.  However, the standard error tables could         
    be very useful.  For instance, they would be useful when one is             
    trying to determine, prior to purchase, whether a 1-percent sample          
    will yield estimates of adequate precision for a given study, or            
    whether it is necessary to use the 5-percent sample instead.  For           
    these purposes the method described in this section should produce an       
    acceptable approximation.  On the other hand, for many statistics,          
    particularly from detailed cross-tabulations, standard errors using         
    the second method are also applicable to a wider variety of                 
    statistics, e.g., means and ratios.                                         
                                                                                
            To produce standard error estimates, one obtains (1) the            
    unadjusted standard error for the characteristic that would result          
    from a simple random sample design (of persons, families, or housing        
    units) and estimation technique; and (2) a design factor, which             
    partially reflects the effects of the actual sample design and              
    estimation procedure used for the 1990 census public use microdata          
    sample, for the particular characteristic estimated.  The design            
    factors provided in this chapter are based on computations from the         
    full census sample and, as such, do not reflect the additional              
    stratification used in the selection of the public use microdata            
    samples (see Chapter 4). In general, these factors will provide             
    conservative estimates of the standard error.  In addition, these           
    factors only pertain to individual data items (e.g., educational

    attainment, employment status) and are not entirely appropriate for         
    use with detailed cross-tabulated data.  To calculate the                   
    approximate standard error of a 5-percent or 1-percent sample               
    estimate follow the steps given below.                                      
                                                                                
    1.      Obtain the unadjusted standard error for the                        
            sampling rate to be used from table A, C, or                        
            E, for estimated totals or from tables B, D,                        
            or F for estimated percentages.  Alternately,                       
            the formula given at the bottom of each table                       
            may be used to calculate the unadjusted                             
            standard error (for sample sizes other than 5                       
            or 1-percent see the subsampling section).                          
                                                                                
            In using tables A, C, or E, or corresponding                        
            formulas for estimated totals, use weighted                         
            figures rather than unweighted sample counts                        
            to select the appropriate row.  To select the                       
            applicable column for person characteristics,                       
            use the total population in the area being                          
            tabulated (not just the total of the universe                       
            being examined), or use the total count of                          
            housing units if the estimated total is a                           
            housing unit characteristic.  Similarly in using                    
            table B, D, or F, or the corresponding                              
            formula for estimated percentages, use                              
            weighted figures to select the appropriate                          
            column.                                                             
                                                                                
    2.      Use table G to obtain the design factor for                         
            the characteristic (e.g., place of work or                          
            educational attainment).  If the estimate is a                      
            cross-tabulation of more than one                                   
            characteristic, scan table G for each                               
            appropriate factor and use the largest factor.                      
            Multiply the unadjusted standard error from                         
            step 1 by the factor obtained in step 2.                            
                                                                                
    Example 1: Standard Error of a Total - Suppose we tally a 5-percent         
    public use microdata sample for state A.  Further, suppose that for         
    county A, the sum of the PUMS weights for all persons is 131,220.           
    The sum of the PUMS weights for those persons who are age 16 years          
    and over and in the civilian labor force is 59,948.                         
                                                                                
            The basic standard error for the estimated total is obtained        
    from table A or from the formula given below table A.  To avoid             
    interpolation, the use of the formula will be demonstrated here.  The       
    formula for the basic standard error, SE, is:                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
            SE(59,948) =  (square root of)  19(59,948) (1-59,948/131,220)

                       =  787 persons                                           
                                                                                
            The standard error of the estimated 59,948 persons 16 years         
    and over who were in the civilian labor force is found by multiplying       
    the basic standard error 787 by the appropriate design factor               
    (Employment Status) from table G.  Suppose the design factor for            
    Employment Status is 1.2, then the standard error is                        
                                                                                
                                                                                
            SE(59,948) = 787(1.2) = 945 persons                                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
            Note that in this example the total weighted count of persons       
    in county A of 131,220 was used.                                            
                                                                                
    Example 2: Standard Error of a Percent - Suppose there are 95,763           
    persons in county A in state A aged 16 years and over.  The estimated       
    percent of persons 16 years and over who were in the civilian labor         
    force is 62.6.  Using the formula given in table B, the unadjusted          
    standard error is found to be approximately 0.68 percent.  The              
    standard error for the estimated 62.6 percent of persons 16 years and       
    over who were in the civilian labor force is 0.68 (1.2) = 0.82              
    percentage points.  Note that in this example the base is defined as        
    the weighted count of persons 16 years old and over.                        
                                                                                
            A note of caution concerning numerical values is necessary.         
    Standard errors of percentages derived in this manner are                   
    approximate.  Calculations can be expressed to several decimal              
    places, but to do so would indicate more precision in the data than         
    is justifiable.  Final results should contain no more than two              
    decimal places.                                                             
                                                                                
    Sums and Differences - The standard errors estimated from these             
    tables are not directly applicable to sums of and differences between       
    two sample estimates.  To estimate the standard error of a sum or           
    difference, the tables are to be used somewhat differently in the           
    following three situations:                                                 
                                                                                
    1.      For the sum of or difference between a                              
            sample estimate and a 100-percent value, use                        
            the standard error of the sample estimate.                          
            The complete count value is not subject to                          
            sampling error.                                                     
                                                                                
    2.      For the sum of or difference between two                            
            sample estimates, the appropriate standard                          
            error is approximately the square root of the                       
            sum of the two individual standard errors                           
            squared, that is, for standard errors:

            This method, however, will underestimate                            
            (overestimate) the standard error if the two                        
            items in a sum are highly positively                                
            (negatively) correlated or if the two items in                      
            a difference are highly negatively (positively)                     
            correlated.  This method may also be used                           
            for the difference between (or sum of)                              
            sample estimates from two censuses or from                          
            a census sample and another survey.  The                            
            standard error for estimates not based on the                       
            1990 census sample must be obtained from                            
            an appropriate source outside of this                               
            appendix.                                                           
                                                                                
    3.      For the differences between two estimates,                          
            one of which is a subclass of the other, use                        
            the tables directly where the calculated                            
            difference is the estimate of interest.                             
                                                                                
    For example, to determine the estimate of non-Black teachers, one may       
    subtract the estimate of Black teachers from the estimate of total          
    teachers.  To determine the standard error of the estimate of               
    non-Black teachers apply the above formula directly.                        
                                                                                
    Ratios - Frequently, the statistic of interest is the ratio of two          
    variables, where the numerator is not a subset of the denominator.          
    For example, the ratio of teachers to students in public elementary         
    schools.  The standard error of the ratio between two sample                
    estimates is estimated as follows:                                          
                                                                                
    1.      If the ratio is a proportion, then follow the                       
            procedure outlined for "Totals and                                  
            Percentages."                                                       
                                                                                
    2.      If the ratio is not a proportion, then                              
            approximate the standard error using the                            
            formula below.

            *  lower case "X" and "Y" indicate subscript here.                  
                                                                                
    Medians - For the standard error of the median of a characteristic,         
    it is necessary to examine the distribution from which the median is        
    derived, as the size of the base and the distribution itself affect         
    the standard error.  An approximate method is given here.  As the           
    first step, compute one-half of the number on which the median is           
    based (refer to this result as N/2).  Treat N/2 as if it were an            
    ordinary estimate and obtain its standard error as instructed above.        
    Compute the desired confidence interval about N/2.  Starting with the       
    lowest value of the characteristic, compute the frequencies in each         
    category of the characteristic until the sum equals or first exceeds        
    the lower limit of the confidence interval about N/2.  By linear            
    interpolation, obtain a value of the characteristic corresponding to        
    this sum.  This is the lower limit of the confidence interval of the        
    median.  In a similar manner, continue cumulating frequencies until         
    the sum equals or exceeds the count in excess of the upper limit of         
    the interval about N/2.  Interpolate as before to obtain the upper          
    limit of the confidence interval for the estimated median.                  
                                                                                
            When interpolation is required in the upper open-ended              
    interval of a distribution to obtain a confidence bound, use 1.5            
    times the lower limit of the open-ended confidence interval as the          
    upper limit of the open-ended interval.                                     
                                                                                
                                                                                
    CONFIDENCE INTERVALS AND INFERENCES BASED ON THE SAMPLE                     
                                                                                
            A sample estimate and its estimated standard error may be           
    used to construct confidence intervals about the estimate.  These           
    intervals are ranges that will contain the average value of the             
    estimated characteristic that results over all possible samples, with       
    a known probability.  For example, if all possible samples that could       
    result under the 1990 census sample design were independently               
    selected and surveyed under the same conditions, and if the estimate        
    and its estimated standard error were calculated for each of these          
    samples, then:                                                              
                                                                                
    1.      Approximately 68 percent of the intervals                           
            from one estimated standard error below the                         
            estimate to one estimated standard error

      ICPSR 9952                                           Page 43              
                                                                                
                                                                                
            The intervals are referred to as 68 percent, 90 percent, and        
    95 percent confidence intervals, respectively.                              
                                                                                
            The average value of the estimated characteristic that could        
    be derived from all possible samples is or is not contained in any          
    particular computed interval.  Thus, we cannot make the statement           
    that the average value has a certain probability of falling between         
    the limits of the calculated confidence interval.  Rather, one can          
    say with a specified probability of confidence, that the calculated         
    confidence interval includes the average estimate from all possible         
    samples (approximately the 100-percent value).                              
                                                                                
            Confidence intervals also may be constructed for the ratio,         
    sum of, or difference between two sample figures.  This is done by          
    first computing the ratio, sum, or difference, then obtaining the           
    standard error of the ratio, sum, or difference (using the formulas         
    given earlier), and finally forming a confidence interval for this          
    estimated ratio, sum, or difference as above.  One can then say with        
    specified confidence that this interval includes the ratio, sum, or         
    difference that would have been obtained by averaging the results           
    from all possible samples.                                                  
                                                                                
            The estimated standard errors given in this chapter do not          
    include all portions of the variability due to nonsampling error that       
    may be present in the data.  The standard errors reflect the effect         
    of simple response variance, but not the effect of correlated errors        
    introduced by enumerators, coders, or other field or processing             
    personnel.  Thus, the standard errors calculated represent a lower          
    bound of that total error.  As a result, confidence intervals formed        
    using these estimated standard errors may not meet the stated levels        
    of confidence (i.e., 68, 90, or 95 percent).                                
                                                                                
    Thus, some care must be exercised in the interpretation of the data         
    in this data product based on the estimated standard errors.                
                                                                                
            In example 1, the standard error of the 59,948 persons 16           
    years and over in county A in state A who were in the civilian labor        
    force was found to be 945.  Thus, a 90 percent confidence interval          
    for this estimated total is found to be:                                    
                                                                                
            (59,948 - 1.645 (945)) to (59,948 + 1.645(945))                     
                                                                                
                                   or                                           
                                                                                
                            58,393 to 61,502                                    
                                                                                
            One can say, with about 90 percent confidence, that this            
    interval includes the value that would have been obtained by                
    averaging the results from all possible samples.                            
                                                                                
            The following is an illustration of the calculation of              
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      Page 44                                           ICPSR 9952              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    standard errors and confidence intervals when a difference between          
    two sample estimates is obtained.  For example, suppose the number of       
    persons in county B age 16 years and over who were in the civilian          
    labor force was 69,314 and the total number of persons 16 years and         
    over was 116,666.  Further, suppose the population of county B was          
    225,225.  Thus, the estimated percentage of persons 16 years and over       
    who were in the civilian labor force is 59.4 percent.  The unadjusted       
    standard error from table B is 0.63 percentage points.  The design          
    factors table (table G) shows the design factor to be 1.1 for               
    "Employment Status."  Thus, the approximate standard error of the           
    percentage (59.4 percent) is 0.63 x 1.2 = 0.76 percentage points.           
                                                                                
            Now suppose that one wished to obtain the standard error of         
    the difference between county A and county B of the percentage of           
    persons who were 16 years and over and who were in the civilian labor       
    force.  The difference in the percentages of interest for the two           
    cities is:                                                                  
                                                                                
            62.6 - 59.4 = 3.2 percent.                                          
                                                                                
    Using the results of the previous example:

                                 or

            One can say with 90 percent confidence that the interval            
    includes the difference that would have been obtained by averaging          
    the results from all possible samples.  When, as in this example, the       
    interval does not include zero, one can conclude, again with 90             
    percent confidence, that the difference observed between the two            
    counties on this characteristic is greater than can be attributed to        
    sampling error.                                                             
                                                                                
            For reasonably large samples, ratio estimates are normally          
    distributed, particularly for the census population.  Therefore, if

    we can calculate the standard error of a ratio estimate, then we can        
    from a confidence interval around the ratio.  Suppose that one wished       
    to obtain the standard error of the ratio of the estimate of persons        
    who were 16 years and over and who were in the civilian labor force         
    in county A to the estimate of persons who were 16 years and over and       
    who were in the civilian labor force in county B.  The ratio of the         
    two estimates of interest is:

            Using the results above, the 90 percent confidence interval         
    for this ratio would be:

    SELECTING AN APPROPRIATE SAMPLE SIZE - One virtue in the use of the         
    tables A through F for calculating standard errors and confidence           
    intervals is that this method can be employed prior to making any           
    sample tabulation, and thus, can help the user decide prior to              
    purchase whether a 5-percent or 1-percent sample size is most               
    appropriate for a proposed study.                                           
                                                                                
    Suppose that in the foregoing example, the 59,948 figure was a guess,       
    perhaps based on published data.  The confidence interval could be          
    calculated as above.  In this case, tabulating a 5-percent sample for       
    this particular characteristic would result in a 90 percent                 
    confidence interval 58,393 to 61,502.  The width of this interval is        
    3,109.  Tabulating from a 1-percent sample for the same                     
    characteristic would result in a confidence interval of 56,403 to           
    63,492.  The width of the interval from the 1-percent sample is 7,089       
    (over two times the width of the confidence interval from the               
    5-percent sample).  Another criterion used in making this type of           
    decision is the coefficient of variation (CV).  The CV is a measure         
    of reliability and is defined as the ratio of the standard error of         
    the estimate and the absolute value of the expected value of the            
    estimate.  To get an estimate of the CV, substitute the estimate            
    itself for the expected value in the CV formula.  In this example, if       
    the 59,948 estimate is obtained from the 5-percent sample, the CV           
    would be 1.4 percent.  If the 1-percent sample is tallied to get the        
    estimate then the CV would be 3 percent.  The smaller the CV, the

    more reliable the estimate.  There is no particular rule of thumb           
    that dictates how large a confidence interval or CV is acceptable.          
    This depends on the relative precision necessary for a particular           
    application as balanced against the relative cost of tabulating             
    microdata samples of the various sizes.                                     
                                                                                
                                                                                
    USING TABLE A THROUGH F FOR OTHER SAMPLE SIZES                              
                                                                                
            Tables A through F may also be used to approximate the              
    unadjusted standard errors for other sample sizes by adjusting for          
    the sample size desired.  The adjustment for sample size is obtained        
    as follows:                                                                 
                                                                                
    Let                                                                         
                                                                                
    f1 be the sampling rate in any of the tables A through F, and               
                                                                                
    f2 be the sampling rate for the sample size to be used.  The                
    adjustment for sample size can be read from the following table:            
                                                                                
    f2              Sample Size Adjustment Factor                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
            For example, if the user were to select a subsample of one          
    half of a 1-percent sample, i.e., f2 = .005, then the standard errors       
    shown in tables C or D for a 1-percent sample must be multiplied by         
    1.42 to obtain the standard errors for a .005 sample.  The factor of        
    1.42 shows that the standard errors increase by 42 percent when the         
    sample size is halved.                                                      
                                                                                
            The principle is also applicable when combining microdata           
    samples to achieve a sample size larger than 5 percent.  If, for            
    example, all three samples are combined for the same area to obtain         
    an estimate of a characteristic for the elderly population, the             
    standard errors for this sample size (i.e., 11 percent) can be              
    obtained by multiplying those shown in tables A and B by .65.  Thus,        
    the increase from a 5-percent to a 11-percent sample reduces the            
    standard error by 35 percent.                                               
                                                                                
            Alternatively, the user may wish to use the following               
    formulas to directly calculate the unadjusted standard errors.  For         
    estimated totals, calculate                                                 
    as

    ESTIMATION OF STANDARD ERRORS DIRECTLY FROM THE MICRODATA SAMPLES           
                                                                                
            Use of tables or formulas to derive approximate standard            
    error as discussed above is simple and does not complicate                  
    processing.  Nonetheless, a more accurate estimate of the standard          
    error can be obtained from the samples themselves, using the random         
    group method.  Using this method it is also possible to compute             
    standard errors for mean ratios, indexes, correlation coefficients,         
    or other statistics for which the tables or formulas presented              
    earlier do not apply.                                                       
                                                                                
            The random group method does increase processing time               
    somewhat since it requires that the statistic of interest, for              
    example a total, be computed separately for each of up to 100 random        
    groups.  The variability of that statistic for the sample as a whole        
    is estimated from the variability of the statistic among the various        
    random groups within the sample.  The procedure for calculating a           
    standard error by the random group method for various statistics is         
    given below.

            The standard error of the estimated total is the square root        
    of var(X).                                                                  
                                                                                
            It is suggested that t=100 for estimating the standard error        
    of a total since, as it is discussed in the next chapter, each of the       
    sample records was assigned a two-digit subsample number sequentially       
    from 00 to 99.  The two-digit number can be used to form 100 random         
    groups.                                                                     
                                                                                
            For example, a sample case with 01 as the two-digit number          
    will be in random group 1.  All sample cases with 02 as the two digit       
    number will be in random group 2, etc., up to 00 as the one-                
    hundredth random group.  The reliability of the random group variance       
    estimator is a function of both the kurtosis of the estimator and the       
    number of groups t.  If t is small, the coefficient of variation (CV)       
    will be large, and therefore, the variance estimator will be of low         
    precision.  In general, the larger t is, the more reliable the              
    variance estimator will be.1

            Care must be exercised when using this variance estimator for       
    complex nonlinear statistics as its properties have not been fully          
    explored for such statistics.  In particular, the choice of the             
    number of random groups must be considered more carefully.  When            
    using the 5-percent sample, use of t=100 for all areas tabulated is         
    recommended.  When using the 1-percent sample or samples having a           
    smaller sampling fraction, the user should consider using a smaller         
    number of random groups to insure that each random group contains at

    least 25 records.  Fewer than 100 random groups can be formed by            
    appropriate combination of the two-digit subsample numbers.  For            
    example, to construct 50 random groups assign all records in which          
    the subsample number is 01 or 50 to the first random group; all             
    records in which the subsample number is 02 or 52 to the second             
    random group, etc.  Finally, assign all records in which the                
    subsample number is 00 or 50 to random group 50.  Ten random groups         
    can be constructed by including all records having subsample numbers        
    with the same "units" digit in a particular random group.  For              
    example, subsample numbers 00,10,...,90 would form one random group;        
    subsample numbers 01,11,...,91 would form a second random group, etc.       
                                                                                
                                                                                
    STANDARD ERRORS FOR SMALL ESTIMATES                                         
                                                                                
            Percentage estimates of zero and estimated totals of zero are       
    subject to both sampling and nonsampling error.  While the magnitude        
    of the error is difficult to quantify, users should be aware that           
    such estimates are nevertheless subject to both sampling and                
    nonsampling error even though in the case of zero estimates the             
    corresponding random groups estimate of variance will be zero.              
                                                                                
            A second point concerning standard errors, the standard error       
    estimates obtained using the random groups method do not include all        
    components of the variability due to nonsampling error that may be          
    present in the data.  Therefore, the standard error calculated using        
    the methods described in this section represent a lower bound for the       
    total error.  Data users should be aware that in general confidence         
    intervals formed using these estimated standard errors do not meet          
    the stated levels of confidence.  Data users are advised to be              
    conservative when making inferences from the data provided in this          
    data product.                                                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
    CONTROL OF NONSAMPLING ERROR                                                
                                                                                
            As mentioned earlier, both sample and 100- percent data are         
    subject to nonsampling error.  This component of error could                
    introduce serious bias into the data, and the total error could             
    increase dramatically over that which would result purely from              
    sampling.  While it is impossible to eliminate completely nonsampling       
    error from an operation as large and complex as the decennial census,       
    the Bureau of the Census attempted to control the sources of such           
    error during the collection and processing operations.  Described           
    below are the primary sources of nonsampling error and the programs         
    instituted for control of this error.  The success of these programs,       
    however, was contingent upon how well the instructions actually were        
    carried out during the census.  As part of the 1990 census evaluation       
    program, both the effects of these programs and the amount of error         
    remaining after their application will be evaluated.

    UNDERCOVERAGE--It is possible for some households or persons to be          
    missed entirely by the census.  The undercoverage of persons and            
    housing units can introduce biases into the data.  Several coverage         
    improvement programs were implemented during the development of the         
    census address list and census enumeration and processing to minimize       
    undercoverage of the population and housing units.  These programs          
    were developed based on experience from the 1980 census and results         
    from the 1990 census testing cycle.  In developing and updating the         
    census address list, the Census Bureau used a variety of specialized        
    procedures in different parts of the country.                               
                                                                                
    o       In the large urban areas, the Census Bureau                         
            purchased and geocoded address lists.                               
            Concurrent with geocoding, the United States                        
            Postal Service (USPS) reviewed and updated                          
            this list.  After the postal check, census                          
            enumerators conducted a dependent canvass                           
            and update operation.  Prior to mailout, in                         
            the fall of 1989, local officials were given the                    
            opportunity to examine block counts of                              
            address listings (local review) and identify                        
            possible errors, and the USPS conducted a                           
            final review.                                                       
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
    o       In small cities, suburban areas, and selected                       
            rural parts of the country, the Census Bureau                       
            created the address list through a listing                          
            operation.  The USPS reviewed and updated                           
            this list, and the Census Bureau reconciled                         
            USPS corrections and updated through a                              
            field operation.  In the fall of 1989, local                        
            officials participated in reviewing block                           
            counts of address listings.  Prior to mailout,                      
            the USPS conducted a final review.                                  
                                                                                
    o       The Census Bureau (rather than the USPS)                            
            conducted a listing operation in the fall of                        
            1989 and delivered census questionnaires in                         
            selected rural and seasonal housing areas in                        
            March of 1990.  In some inner-city public                           
            housing developments, whose addresses had                           
            been obtained via the purchased address list                        
            noted above, census questionnaires were also

            Coverage improvement programs continued during and after            
    mailout.  A recheck of units initially classified as vacant or              
    nonexistent further improved the coverage of persons and housing            
    units.  All local officials were given the opportunity to participate

    in a post-census local review, and census enumerators conducted an          
    additional recanvass.  In addition, efforts were made to improve the        
    coverage of unique population groups, such as the homeless and              
    parolees/probationers.  Computer and clerical edits and telephone and       
    personal visit followup also contributed to improved coverage.              
                                                                                
            More extensive discussion of the programs implemented to            
    improve coverage will be published by the Census Bureau when the            
    evaluation of the coverage improvement program is completed.                
                                                                                
    RESPONDENT AND ENUMERATOR ERROR--The persons answering the                  
    questionnaire or responding to the questions posed by an enumerator         
    could serve as a source of error, although the questions were phrased       
    as clearly as possible based on precensus tests, and detailed               
    instructions for completing the questionnaire were provided to each         
    household.  In addition, respondents' answers were edited for               
    completeness and consistency, and problems were followed up as              
    necessary.                                                                  
                                                                                
            The enumerator may misinterpret or otherwise incorrectly            
    record information given by a respondent; may fail to collect some of       
    the information for a person or household; or may collect data for          
    households that were not designated as part of the sample.  To              
    control these problems, the work of enumerators was monitored               
    carefully.  Field staff were prepared for their tasks by using              
    standardized training packages that included hands-on experience in         
    using census materials.  A sample of the households interviewed by          
    enumerators for nonresponse were reinterviewed to control for the           
    possibility of data for fabricated persons being submitted by               
    enumerators.  Also, the estimation procedure was designed to control        
    for biases that would result from the collection of data from               
    households not designated for the sample.                                   
                                                                                
    PROCESSING ERROR--The many phases involved in processing the census         
    data represent potential sources for the introduction of nonsampling        
    error.  The processing of the census questionnaires includes the            
    field editing, followup, and transmittal of completed questionnaires;       
    the manual coding of write-in responses; and the electronic data            
    processing.  The various field, coding and computer operations              
    undergo a number of quality control checks to insure their accurate         
    application.                                                                
                                                                                
    NONRESPONSE--Nonresponse to particular questions on the census              
    questionnaire allows for the introduction of bias into the data,            
    since the characteristics of the nonrespondents have not been               
    observed and may differ from those reported by respondents.  As a           
    result, any imputation procedure using respondent data may not              
    completely reflect this difference either at the elemental level            
    (individual person or housing unit) or on the average.  Some                
    protection against the introduction of large biases is afforded by          
    minimizing nonresponse.  In the census, nonresponse was reduced             
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      ICPSR 9952                                           Page 53              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    substantially during the field operations by the various edit and           
    followup operations aimed at obtaining a response for every question.       
    Characteristics for the nonresponses remaining after this operation         
    were imputed by the computer by using reported data for a person or         
    housing unit with similar characteristics.                                  
                                                                                
                                                                                
    EDITING OF UNACCEPTABLE DATA                                                
                                                                                
            The objective of the processing operation is to produce a set       
    of data that describes the population as accurately and clearly as          
    possible.  To meet this objective, questionnaires were edited during        
    field data collection operations for consistency, completeness, and         
    acceptability.  Questionnaires also were reviewed by census clerks          
    for omissions, certain specific inconsistencies, and population             
    coverage.  For example, write-in entries such as "Don't know" or "NA"       
    were considered unacceptable.  For some district offices, the initial       
    edit was automated; however, for the majority of the district               
    offices, it was performed by clerks.  As a result of this operation,        
    a telephone or personal visit followup was made to obtain missing           
    information.  Potential coverage errors were included in the                
    followup, as well as a sample of questionnaires with omissions and/or       
    inconsistencies.                                                            
                                                                                
            Subsequent to field operations, remaining incomplete or             
    inconsistent information on the questionnaire was assigned using            
    imputation procedures during the final automated edit of the                
    collected data.  Imputations, or computer assignments of acceptable         
    codes in place of unacceptable entries or blanks, are needed most           
    often when an entry for a given item is lacking or when the                 
    information reported for a person or housing unit on that item is           
    inconsistent with other information for that same person or housing         
    unit.  As in previous censuses, the general procedure for changing          
    unacceptable entries was to assign an entry for a person or housing         
    unit that was consistent with entries for persons or housing units          
    with similar characteristics.  The assignment of acceptable codes in        
    place of blanks or unacceptable entries enhances the usefulness of          
    the data.                                                                   
                                                                                
            Another way in which corrections were made during the               
    computer editing process was through substitution; that is, the             
    assignment of a full set of characteristics for a person or housing         
    unit.  When there was an indication that a housing unit was occupied        
    but the questionnaire contained no information for the people within        
    the household or the occupants were not listed on the questionnaire,        
    a previously accepted household was selected as a substitute, and the       
    full set of characteristics for the substitute was duplicated.  The         
    assignment of the full set of housing characteristics occurred when         
    there was no housing information available.  If the housing unit was        
    determined to be occupied, the housing characteristics were assigned        
    from a previously processed occupied unit.  If the housing unit was

    vacant, the housing characteristics were assigned from a previously         
    processed vacant unit.                                                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
    USE OF ALLOCATION FLAGS IN THESE FILES                                      
                                                                                
            As a result of the editing there are no blank fields or             
    missing data in public use microdata sample files.  Each field              
    contains a data value or a "not applicable" indicator, except for the       
    few items where allocation was not appropriate and a "not reported"         
    indicator is included.  For every subject item it is possible for the       
    user to differentiate between entries which were allocated, by means        
    of "allocation flags" in items H161 through H198, and P186 through          
    P233 in the microdata files.  For all items it is possible to compute       
    the allocation rate and, if the rate is appreciable, compute the            
    distribution of actually observed values (with allocated data               
    omitted) and compare it with the overall distribution including             
    allocated values.  The flags indicate the changes in values between         
    input and output.                                                           
                                                                                
            These flags may indicate up to four possible types of               
    allocations:                                                                
                                                                                
    A.      Pre-edit - When the original entry was                              
            rejected because it fell outside the range of                       
            acceptable values.                                                  
                                                                                
    B.      Consistency - Imputed missing characteristics                       
            based on other information recorded for the                         
            person or housing unit.                                             
                                                                                
    C.      Hot Deck - Supplied the missing information                         
            from the record of another person or housing                        
            unit.                                                               
                                                                                
    D.      Cold Deck - Supplied missing information                            
            from a predetermined distribution.                                  
                                                                                
            In general, the allocation procedures provide better data           
    than could be obtained by simply weighting up the observed                  
    distribution to account for missing values.  The procedures reflect         
    local variations in characteristics as well as variations among the         
    strata used in imputation.  There are, however, certain circumstances       
    where allocated data may introduce undesirable bias.  It may be             
    particularly important to analyze allocations of data in detailed           
    studies of subpopulations or in statistics derived from cross-              
    classification of variables, such as correlation coefficients or            
    measures of regression.  The degree of editing required was greater         
    for some subjects than for others.  While the allocation procedure          
    was designed to yield appropriate statistics for the overall                
    distribution or for specific subpopulations (the strata used in the

    allocation process), allocated characteristics will not necessarily         
    observe a valid relationship with other observed variables for the          
    same individual.  For example, consider a tabulation of persons 80          
    years old and over by income.  Income allocations were made                 
    separately for different age groupings, including the category 65           
    years old and over, but not separately for persons 80 years old and         
    over.                                                                       
                                                                                
            Since persons 65 to 70 or 75 are more likely to have                
    significant earnings than persons 80 or over, allocated income data         
    for the latter group might be biased upward.  Thus, if the rate of          
    allocations for the group is appreciably large, and a bias in the           
    allocated value is evident, it may be desirable to exclude allocated        
    data from the analysis.                                                     
                                                                                
            It should also be apparent from this illustration that              
    knowledge of the specific allocation procedures is valuable in              
    detailed subject analysis.  Descriptions of the editing and                 
    allocation procedures for each item are being incorporated in the

    later.  A user may contact either the Population Division or Housing

            This chapter discusses the selection procedure for the public       
    use microdata samples in terms of four major operations, (1) the            
    selection of the full 1990 census sample, (2) the estimation                
    procedure for the full census sample, and (3) the selection of the          
    public use microdata samples from the persons and housing units

    PUMS samples.                                                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
    PRODUCING ESTIMATES OR TABULATIONS                                          
                                                                                
            Estimation of totals and percentages - The 1980 Public Use          
    Microdata Samples (PUMS) were self-weighted.  It is very important to       
    note that the 1990 PUMS samples are not self-weighted.  To produce          
    estimates on tabulations of 100 percent characteristics from the PUMS       
    files simply add the weights of all persons or housing units that           
    possess the characteristic of interest.  For instance, if the               
    characteristic of interest is total number of Hispanic males aged           
    5-17, simply determine the sex, age, and Hispanic origin of all             
    persons and cumulate the weights of those who match the                     
    characteristic of interest.  The PUMS weight is a function of the           
    full census sample weight and the PUMS sample design.                       
                                                                                
            To get estimates of proportions simply divide the weighted          
    estimate of persons or housing units with a given characteristic by         
    the base sample estimate.  For example, the proportion of owner             
    occupied housing units with plumbing facilities is obtained by              
    dividing the PUMS estimate of owner occupied housing units with             
    plumbing facilities by the PUMS estimates of total housing units.           
                                                                                
            To get estimates of characteristics such as the total number        
    of related children in households for (housing unit level                   
    aggregates), simply multiply the PUMS weight by the value of the            
    characteristic and sum across all household records.  If the desired        
    estimate is the number of households with at least one related child        
    in household add the PUMS householder weight for all households with        
    a value not equal to zero for the characteristic.

            Every person and housing unit in the United States was asked        
    certain basic demographic questions (for example, race, age,                
    relationship, housing value, or rent).  A sample of these persons and       
    housing units was asked more detailed questions about such items as         
    income, occupation, and housing costs in addition to the basic              
    demographic and housing information.

    the 1990 census was the housing unit, including all occupants.  For         
    persons living in group quarters, the sampling unit was the person.         
    Persons in group quarters were sampled at a 1-in-6 rate.                    
                                                                                
            The sample designation method depended on the data collection       
    procedures.  Approximately 95 percent of the population was                 
    enumerated by the mailback procedure.  In these areas, the Bureau of        
    the Census either purchased a commercial mailing list, which was            
    updated by the United States Postal Service and Census Bureau field         
    staff, or prepared a mailing by canvassing and listing each address         
    in the area prior to Census Day.  These lists were computerized and         
    the appropriate units were electronically designated as sample units.       
    The questionnaires were either mailed or hand delivered to the              
    addresses with instructions on how to complete and mail back the            
    form.  Housing units in governmental units with a precensus (1988)          
    estimated population of fewer than 2,500 persons were sampled at            
    1-in-2. Governmental units were defined for sampling purposes as            
    all incorporated places, all counties, all county equivalents such as       
    parishes in Louisiana, and all minor civil divisions in Connecticut,        
    Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey,       
    New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin.               
    Housing units in tracts and block numbering areas (BNAs) with a             
    precensus housing unit count below 2,000 housing units were sampled         
    at 1-in-6 for those portions not in small governmental units.               
    Housing units within census tracts and BNAs with 2,000 or more              
    housing units were sampled at 1-in-8 for those portions not in small        
    governmental units.                                                         
                                                                                
            In list/enumerate areas (about 5 percent of the population)         
    each enumerator was given a blank address register with designated          
    sample lines.  Beginning about Census Day, the enumerator                   
    systematically canvassed the area and listed all housing units in the       
    address register in the order they were encountered.  Completed             
    questionnaires, including sample information for any housing unit           
    listed on a designated sample line, were collected.  For all                
    governmental units with fewer than 2,500 persons in list/enumerate          
    areas, a 1-in-2 sampling rate was used.  All other list/enumerate           
    areas were sampled at 1-in-6.                                               
                                                                                
            Housing units in American Indian reservations, Tribal               
    Jurisdiction Statistical areas, and Alaska Native villages were             
    sampled according to the same criteria as other governmental units,         
    except the sampling rates were based on the size of the American            
    Indian and Alaska native population in those areas as measured in the       
    1980 census.  Trust lands were sampled at the same rate as their            
    associated American Indian reservations.  Census designated places in       
    Hawaii were sampled at the same rate as governmental units because          
    the Census Bureau does not recognize incorporated places in Hawaii.         
                                                                                
            The purpose of using variable sampling rates was to provide         
    relatively more reliable estimates for small areas and decrease

    respondent burden in more densely populated areas while maintaining         
    data reliability.  When all sampling rates were taken into account          
    across the nation, approximately one out of every six housing units         
    in the nation was included in the 1990 census sample.                       
                                                                                
                                                                                
    ESTIMATION PROCEDURE                                                        
                                                                                
            Estimates from the census sample were obtained from an              
    iterative ratio estimation procedure (iterative proportional fitting)       
    resulting in the assignment of a weight to each sample person or            
    housing unit record.  For any given tabulation area, a characteristic       
    total was estimated by summing the weights assigned to the persons or       
    housing units processing the characteristic in the tabulation area.         
    Estimates of family or household characteristics were based on the          
    weight assigned to the person designated as householder.  Each sample       
    person or housing unit record was assigned exactly one weight to be         
    used to produce estimates of all characteristics.  For example, if          
    the weight given to a sample person or housing unit had the value 6,        
    all characteristics of that person or housing unit would be tabulated       
    with the weight of 6.  The estimation procedure, however, did assign        
    weights varying from person to person or housing unit to housing            
    unit.  The estimation procedure used to assign the weight was               
    performed in geographically defined "weighting areas".  Weighting           
    areas were generally formed of contiguous portions of geography which       
    closely agreed with census tabulation areas within counties.                
    Weighting areas were never allowed to cross state or county                 
    boundaries.  In small counties with a sample unit below 400 persons,        
    the minimum required sample condition was relaxed to permit the             
    entire county to become a weighting area.                                   
                                                                                
            Within a weighting area, the ratio estimation procedure for         
    persons was performed in four stages.  For persons, the first stage         
    applied 17 household-type groups.  The second stage used two groups:        
    sampling rate of 1-in-2 and sampling rate below 1-in-2.  The third          
    stage used the dichotomy householder/nonhouseholders.  The fourth           
    stage applied 180 aggregate age/sex/Hispanic origin/race categories.        
                                                                                
    The stages were as follows:

    Within a weighting area, the first step in the estimation procedure         
    was to assign an initial weight to each sample person record.  This         
    weight was approximately equal to the inverse of the probability of         
    selecting a person for the census sample.                                   
                                                                                
            The next step in the estimation procedure, prior to iterative       
    proportional fitting, was to combine categories in each of the four         
    estimation stages, when needed, to increase the reliability of the          
    ratio estimation procedure.  For each stage, any group that did not         
    meet certain criteria for the unweighted sample count or for the            
    ratio of the 100 percent to the initially weighted sample count, was        
    combined, or collapsed, with another group in the same stage                
    according to a specified collapsing pattern.  At the forth stage, an        
    additional criterion concerning the number of 100-percent persons in        
    each race/Hispanic origin category was applied.                             
                                                                                
            As the final step, the initial weights underwent four stages        
    of ratio adjustment applying the grouping procedures described above.       
    At the first stage, the ratio of the 100- percent to the sum of the         
    initial weights for each sample person was computed for each stage I        
    group.  The initial weight assigned to each person in a group was           
    then multiplied by the stage I group ratio to produce an adjusted           
    weight.                                                                     
                                                                                
            In stage II, the stage I adjusted weights were again adjusted       
    by the ratio of the 100-percent to the sum of the stage I weights for

    sample persons in each stage II group.  Next, at stage III, the stage       
    II weights were adjusted by the ratio of the 100-percent to the sum         
    of the stage II weights for sample persons in each stage III group.         
    Finally, at stage IV, the stage III weights were adjusted by the            
    ratio of the 100-percent to the sum of the stage III weights for            
    sample persons in each stage IV group.  The four stages of ratio            
    adjustment were performed two times (two iterations) in the order           
    given above.  The weights obtained from the second iteration for            
    stage IV were assigned to the sample person records.  However, to           
    avoid complications in rounding for tabulated data, only whole number       
    weights were assigned.  For example, if the final weight of the             
    persons in a particular group was 7.25 then 1/4 of the sample persons       
    in this group were randomly assigned a weight of 8, while the               
    remaining 3/4 received a weight of 7.                                       
                                                                                
            The ratio estimation procedure for housing units was                
    essentially the same as that for persons, except that vacant units          
    were treated differently.  The occupied housing unit ratio estimation       
    procedure was done in four stages, and the vacant housing unit ratio        
    estimation procedure was done in a single stage.  The first stage for       
    occupied housing units applied 16 household type categories, while          
    the second stage used the two sampling categories described above for       
    persons.  The third stage applied three units-in-building categories,       
    i.e. single units, multiunit less than 10 and multiunit 10 or more.         
    The fourth stage could potentially use 200 tenure/race/Hispanic             
    origin/rent value groups.  The stages for ratio estimation for

            The estimates produced by this procedure realize some of the        
    gains in sampling efficiency that would have resulted if the                
    population had been stratified into the ratio- estimation group             
    before sampling, and the sampling rate had been applied independently       
    to each group.  The net effect is a reduction in both the standard          
    error and the possible bias of most estimated characteristic to             
    levels below what would have resulted from simply using the initial         
    (unadjusted) weight.  A by-product of this estimation procedure is          
    that the estimates from the sample will for the most part be                
    consistent with the 100-percent figures for the population and              
    housing unit groups used in the estimation procedure.                       
                                                                                
                                                                                
    SELECTION OF THE PUBLIC USE MICRODATA SAMPLES                               
                                                                                
            A stratified systematic selection procedure with equal              
    probability was used to select each of the public use microdata             
    samples.  The sampling universe was defined as all occupied housing         
    units including all occupants, vacant housing units, and GQ persons         
    in the census sample.  The sample units were stratified during the          
    selection process.  The stratification was intended to improve the          
    reliability of estimates derived from the public use microdata              
    samples by defining strata within which there is a high degree of           
    homogeneity among the census sample households with respect to              
    characteristics of major interest.                                          
                                                                                
            A total of 1,049 strata were defined; 936 household strata,         
    104 strata for GQ persons, and 9 strata for vacant housing units.           
    First, the units were divided into three major groups; households,          
    vacant housing units, and GQ population.  The household universe was        
    stratified by family type and non-family, race/Hispanic origin of the       
    householder, tenure, and age within sampling stratum.  For the census       
    sample selection the population was stratified by geographic size           
    into three sampling strata, i.e., units in small governmental units         
    were sampled at 1-in-2, units in small tract/BNAs were sampled at           
    1-in-6, and the remainder of the units were sampled at 1-in-8.              
                                                                                
            The vacant housing units universe was stratified by vacancy         
    status and sampling rate.  Finally, the GQ population was stratified        
    by GQ type (institutions, non- institutions), race, Hispanic origin,        
    and age.  The stratification matrices are defined in tables A, B, and       
    C.

    SUBSAMPLING THE PUMS FILES                                                  
                                                                                
            The sample selection procedures were as follows.  The number        
    of 1-percent public use microdata samples for a given state was             
    determined by the full census sample size for that state.  For              
    instance, if the full census sample for a state was 20 percent, then        
    the census sample was divided into 20 subsamples of equal size.  The        
    1-percent public use microdata sample was designated at random from         
    the 20 subsamples.  From the remaining 19 subsamples, five 1 percent        
    subsamples were designated at random and merged to produce the              
    5-percent public use microdata sample.  The 3-percent elderly public        
    use microdata sample was produced in the same way as the 5-percent          
    but required an extra step.  The 3 subsamples were merged and the           
    elderly household and person records, households with at least one          
    person age 60 years or more, or GQ persons 60 years and older, were         
    selected and designated as the elderly PUMS file.                           
                                                                                
            During the sample selection operation, consecutive two-digit        
    subsample numbers from 00 to 99 were assigned to each sample case in        
    the 5-percent and 1-percent samples to allow for the designation of         
    various size subsamples and, as discussed in the preceding chapter,         
    to allow for the calculation of standard error.  As an example, for a       
    1-percent public use microdata sample, the choice of records having         
    subsample numbers with the same "units" digit (e.g., the two "units"        
    digit includes subsample numbers (2,12,22,....,92) will provide a           
    1-in-1000 subsample.                                                        
                                                                                
            Samples of any size between 1/20 and 1/10000 may be selected        
    in a similar manner by using appropriate two-digit subsample numbers        
    assigned to either of the microdata samples.  Care must be exercised        
    when selecting such samples.  If only one "units" digit is required,        
    the units digit should be randomly selected.  If two "units" digits         
    are required, the first should be randomly selected and the second          
    should be either 5 more or 5 less than the first.  Failure to use           
    this procedure, e.g., selection of records with the same "tens" digit       
    instead of records with the same "units" digit, would provide a             
    1-in-10 subsample but one that would be somewhat more clustered and         
    as a result subject to larger sampling error.

    2. Value of units in this category results from other factors besides       
       housing value alone, for example, inclusion of more than 10 acres

                         CHAPTER 5: RECORD CONTENTS                             
                                                                                
    This chapter, in conjunction with several appendices, defines the           
    record layout and applicable codes for the public-use microdata             
    samples.  The detailed data dictionary begins on page 5-10 for the          
    housing record and page 5-18 for the person record, with explanatory        
    notes on page C-1 in appendix C.                                            
                                                                                
    For user convenience, we are providing several indexes which can be         
    used for either PUMS file.  Again, the only difference between the          
    files is the PUMA. Note the variable PSA is only applicable to the 3%       
    elderly file--a file which was sponsored by agencies outside the            
    Census Bureau. It contains "Planning Services Areas, identified by          
    the states' health planning agencies.  Purchasers of that file will         
    receive a geographic database which equates PSAs to 5% PUMAs if and         
    only if the PSAs match the PUMs. There is no additional geography.          
                                                                                
    Below is an index to the basic data items.  The index by character          
    location of the items on the housing and person records follows.  In        
    these introductory pages, data fields are specified in the form "H9"        
    or "P12-14," where the letter indicates the Housing or Person record        
    and the numbers indicate the character positions occupied on that           
    record. For example, "P12-14", is a three-character field beginning         
    in character 12 of the person record. in the data dictionary, itself,       
    the "P", or "H" designation appears only at the top of the page, and        
    location is expressed in terms of two separate elements, the                
    beginning location and the size for each mnemonic.  The mnemonic is a       
    name for a variable or item.

    User Notes supply file purchasers with additional or corrected              
    information which becomes available after the technical documentation       
    or files are prepared.  They are issued in a numbered series and            
    automatically mailed to all users who purchase technical                    
    documentation from the Census Bureau.  Other users may obtain them by       
    subscribing to the User Note series.  Contact Customer Services             
    (301-763-4100) for subscription information.                                
                                                                                
    Each User Note has a cover sheet which should be filed following this       
    page.  Technical documentation replacement pages will follow the            
    cover sheet.  These pages need to be filed in their proper location

    Please add the following pages (C-7 - C-12) to Appendix C. Pages C-7 -      
    C-8 describe how to make estimates when combining the various PUMS files:   
    (eg. 5%, 1% and 3% files).  Pages C-9 through C-12 provide control counts   
    and state medians for the files.

    Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRC's) are corporate entities         
    established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1972,          
    Public Law 92-203, as amended by Public Law 94-204, to conduct both         
    business and nonprofit affairs of Alaska Natives.  Alaska is divided        
    into 12 ANRC's that cover the entire State, except for the Annette          
    Islands Reserve.  The boundaries of the 12 ANRC's were established by       
    the Department of the Interior, in cooperation with Alaska Natives.         
    Each ANRC was designed to include, as far as practicable, Alaska            
    Natives with a common heritage and common interests.  The ANRC              
    boundaries for the 1990 census were identified by the Bureau of Land        
    Management.  A 13th region was established for Alaska Natives who are       
    not permanent residents and who chose not to enroll in one of the 12        
    ANRC's; no census products are prepared for the 13th region.  ANRC's        
    were first identified for the 1980 census.                                  
                                                                                
    Each ANRC is assigned a two-digit census code ranging from 07 through       
    84.  These census codes are assigned in alphabetical order of the           
    ANRC's.

    Alaska Native villages (ANV's) constitute tribes, bands, clans,             
    groups, villages, communities, or associations in Alaska that are           
    recognized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of           
    1972, Public Law 92-203.  Because ANV's do not have legally                 
    designated boundaries, the Census Bureau has established Alaska             
    Native village statistical areas (ANVSA's) for statistical purposes.        
    For the 1990 census, the Census Bureau cooperated with officials of         
    the nonprofit corporation within each participating Alaska Native           
    Regional Corporation (ANRC), as well as other knowledgeable                 
    officials, to delineate boundaries that encompass the settled area          
    associated with each ANV.  ANVSA's are located within ANRC's and do         
    not cross ANRC boundaries.  ANVSA's for the 1990 census replace the         
    ANV's that the Census Bureau recognized for the 1980 census.                
                                                                                
    Each ANVSA is assigned a four-digit census code ranging from 6001           
    through 8989.  Each ANVSA also is assigned a five-digit FIPS code.          
    Both the census and FIPS codes are assigned in alphabetical order of        
    ANVSA's.                                                                    
                                                                                
    AMERICAN INDIAN RESERVATION AND TRUST LAND                                  
                                                                                
    AMERICAN INDIAN RESERVATION--Federal American Indian reservations are       
    areas with boundaries established by treaty, statute, and/or                
    executive or court order, and recognized by the Federal Government as       
    territory in which American Indian tribes have jurisdiction.  State         
    reservations are lands held in trust by State governments for the use       
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      Page 142                                          ICPSR 9952              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    and benefit of a given tribe.  The reservations and their boundaries        
    were identified for the 1990 census by the Bureau of Indian Affairs         
    (BIA), Department of Interior (for Federal reservations), and State         
    governments (for State reservations).  The names of American Indian         
    reservations recognized by State governments, but not by the Federal        
    Government, are followed by "(State)."  Areas composed of reservation       
    lands that are administered jointly and/or are claimed by two               
    reservations, as identified by the BIA, are called "joint areas," and       
    are treated as separate American Indian reservations for census             
    purposes.  Federal reservations may cross State boundaries, and             
    Federal and State reservations may cross county, county subdivision,        
    and place boundaries.  For reservations that cross State boundaries,        
    only the portion of the reservations in a given State are shown in          
    the data products for that State; the entire reservations are shown         
    in data products for the United States.                                     
                                                                                
    Each American Indian reservation is assigned a four-digit census code       
    ranging from 0001 through 4989.  These census codes are assigned in         
    alphabetical order of American Indian reservations nationwide, except       
    that joint areas appear at the end of the code range.  Each American        
    Indian reservation also is assigned a five-digit FIPS code; because         
    the FIPS codes are assigned in alphabetical sequence of American            
    Indian reservations within each State, the FIPS code is different in        
    each State for reservations in more than one State.                         
                                                                                
    TRUST LAND--Trust lands are property associated with a particular           
    American Indian reservation or tribe, held in trust by the Federal          
    Government.  Trust lands may be held in trust either for a tribe            
    (tribal trust land) or for an individual member of a tribe                  
    (individual trust land).  Trust lands recognized for the 1990 census        
    comprise all tribal trust lands and inhabited individual tribal lands       
    located outside of a reservation boundary.  As with other American          
    Indian areas, trust lands may be located in more than one State.            
    Only the trust lands in a given State are shown in the data products        
    for that State; all trust lands associated with a reservation or            
    tribe are shown in data products for the United States.  The Census         
    Bureau first reported data for tribal trust lands for the 1980              
    census.  Trust lands are assigned a four-digit census code and a            
    five-digit FIPS code, the same as that for the reservation with which       
    they are associated Trust lands not associated with a reservation are       
    presented by tribal name, interspersed alphabetically among the             
    reservations.                                                               
                                                                                
    TRIBAL DESIGNATED STATISTICAL AREA (TDSA)                                   
                                                                                
    Tribal designated statistical areas (TDSA's) are areas, delineated          
    outside Oklahoma by federally-and State-recognized tribes without a         
    land base or associated trust lands, to provide statistical areas for       
    which the Census Bureau tabulates data.  TDSA's represent areas             
    generally containing the American Indian population over which              
    federally-recognized tribes have jurisdiction and areas in which            
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      ICPSR 9952                                          Page 143              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    State tribes provide benefits and services to their members.  The           
    names of TDSA's delineated by State-recognized tribes are followed by       
    "(State)."  The Census Bureau did not recognize TDSA's before the           
    1990 census.                                                                
                                                                                
    Each TDSA is assigned a four-digit census code ranging from 9001            
    through 9589.  The census codes are assigned in alphabetical order of       
    TDSA's nationwide.  Each TDSA also is assigned a five-digit FIPS code       
    in alphabetical order within State.                                         
                                                                                
    TRIBAL JURISDICTION STATISTICAL AREA (TJSA)                                 
                                                                                
    Tribal jurisdiction statistical areas (TJSA's) are areas, delineated        
    by federally-recognized tribes in Oklahoma without a reservation, for       
    which the Census Bureau tabulates data.  TJSA's represent areas             
    generally containing the American Indian population over which one or       
    more tribal governments have jurisdiction; if tribal officials              
    delineated adjacent TJSA's so that they include some duplicate              
    territory, the overlap area is called a "joint use area," which is          
    treated as a separate TJSA for census purposes.                             
                                                                                
    TJSA's replace the "Historic Areas of Oklahoma (excluding urbanized         
    areas)" shown in 1980 census data products.  The Historic Areas of          
    Oklahoma comprised the territory located within reservations that had       
    legally established boundaries from 1900 to 1907; these reservations        
    were dissolved during the 2- to 3-year period preceding the statehood       
    of Oklahoma in 1907.  The Historic Areas of Oklahoma (excluding             
    urbanized areas) were identified only for the 1980 census.                  
                                                                                
    Each TJSA is assigned a four-digit census code ranging from 5001            
    through 5989.  The census codes are assigned in alphabetical order of       
    TJSA's, except that joint areas appear at the end of the code range.        
    Each TJSA also is assigned a five-digit FIPS code in alphabetical           
    order within Oklahoma.                                                      
                                                                                
    AREA MEASUREMENT                                                            
                                                                                
    Area measurements provide the size, in square kilometers (also in           
    square miles in printed reports), recorded for each geographic entity       
    for which the Census Bureau tabulates data in general-purpose data          
    products (except crews-of-vessels entities and ZIP Codes).  (Square         
    kilometers may be divided by 2.59 to convert an area measurement to         
    square miles.)  Area was calculated from the specific set of                
    boundaries recorded for the entity in the Census Bureau's geographic        
    data base (see "TIGER").  On machine-readable files, area                   
    measurements are shown to three decimal places; the decimal point is        
    implied.  In printed reports and listings, area measurements are            
    shown to one decimal.                                                       
                                                                                
    The Census Bureau provides measurements for both land area and total        
    water area for the 1990 census; the water figure includes inland,

    coastal, Great Lakes, and territorial water.  (For the 1980 census,         
    the Census Bureau provided area measurements for land and inland            
    water.)  The Census Bureau will provide measurements for the                
    component types of water for the affected entities in a separate            
    file.  "Inland water" consists of any lake, reservoir, pond, or             
    similar body of water that is recorded in the Census Bureau's               
    geographic data base.  it also includes any river, creek, canal,            
    stream, or similar feature that is recorded in that data base as a          
    two-dimensional feature (rather than as a single line).  The portions       
    of the oceans and related large embayments (such as the Chesapeake          
    Bay and Puget Sound), the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea that        
    belong to the United States and its possessions are considered to be        
    "coastal" and "territorial" waters; the Great Lakes are treated as a        
    separate water entity.  Rivers and bays that empty into these bodies        
    of water are treated as "inland water" from the point beyond which          
    they are narrower than one nautical mile across.  Identification of         
    land and inland, coastal, and territorial waters is for statistical         
    purposes, and does not necessarily reflect legal definitions thereof.       
                                                                                
    By definition, census blocks do not include water within their              
    boundaries; therefore, the water area of a block is always zero.            
    Land area measurements may disagree with the information displayed on       
    census maps and in the TIGER file because, for area measurement             
    purposes, features identified as "intermittent water" and "glacier"         
    are reported as land area.  For this reason, it may not be possible         
    to derive the land area for an entity by summing the land area of its       
    component census blocks.  In addition, the water area measurement           
    reported for some geographic entities includes water that is not            
    included in any lower-level geographic entity.  Therefore, because          
    water is contained only in a higher-level geographic entity, summing        
    the water measurements for all the component lower-level geographic         
    entities will not yield the water area of that higher-level entity.         
    This occurs, for example, where water is associated with a county but       
    is not within the legal boundary at any minor civil division, or the        
    water is associated with a State but is not within the legal boundary       
    of any county.  Crews-of -vessels entities (see "Census Tract and           
    Block Numbering Area" and "Block") do not encompass territory and           
    therefore have no area measurements.  ZIP Codes do not have specific        
    boundaries, and therefore, also do not have area measurements.              
                                                                                
    The accuracy of any area measurement figure is limited by the               
    inaccuracy inherent in (1) the location and shape of the various            
    boundary features in the data base, and (2) rounding affecting the          
    last digit in all operations that compute and/or sum the area

    Tabulation blocks, used in census data products, are in most cases          
    the same as collection blocks, used in the census enumeration.  In          
    some cases, collection blocks have been "split" into two or more            
    parts required for data tabulations.  Tabulation blocks do not cross        
    the boundaries of counties, county subdivisions, places, census             
    tracts or block numbering areas.  American Indian and Alaska Native         
    areas, congressional districts, voting districts, urban or rural            
    areas, or urbanized areas.  The 1990 census is the first for which          
    the entire United States and its possessions are block-numbered.            
                                                                                
    Blocks are numbered uniquely within each census tract or BNA.  A            
    block is identified by a three-digit number, sometimes with a single        
    alphabetical suffix.  Block numbers with suffixes generally represent       
    collection blocks that were "split" in order to identify separate           
    geographic entities that divide the original block.  For example,           
    when a city limit runs through data collection block 101, the data          
    for the portion inside the city is tabulated in block 101 A and the         
    portion outside, in block 101B.  A block number with the suffix "Z"         
    represents a "crews-of-vessels" entity for which the Census Bureau          
    tabulates data, but that does not represent a true geographic area;         
    such a block is shown on census maps associated with an anchor symbol       
    and a census tract or block numbering area with a .99 suffix.               
                                                                                
    BLOCK GROUP (BG)                                                            
                                                                                
    GEOGRAPHIC BLOCK GROUP                                                      
                                                                                
    A geographic block group (BG) is a cluster of blocks having the same        
    first digit of their three-digit identifying numbers within a census        
    tract or block numbering area (BNA).  For example, BG 3 within a            
    census tract or BNA includes all blocks numbered between 301 and 397.       
    In most cases, the numbering involves substantially fewer than 97           
    blocks.  Geographic BG's never cross census tract or BNA boundaries,        
    but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, American       
    Indian and Alaska Native areas, urbanized areas, voting districts,          
    and congressional districts.  BG's generally contain between 250 and        
    550 housing units, with the ideal size being 400 housing units.             
                                                                                
    TABULATION BLOCK GROUP                                                      
                                                                                
    In the data tabulations, a geographic BG may be split to present data       
    for every unique combination of county subdivision, place, American         
    Indian and Alaska Native area, urbanized area, voting district,             
    urban/rural and congressional district shown in the data product; for       
    example, if BG3 is partly in a city and partly outside the city,            
    there will be separate tabulated records for each portion of BG3.           
    BG's are used in tabulating decennial census data nationwide in the         
    1990 census, in all block-numbered areas in the 1980 census, and in         
    Tape Address Register (TAR) areas in the 1970 census.

    districts (ED's) used for reporting data in many parts of the United        
    States for the 1970 and 1980 censuses, and in all areas for pre-1970        
    censuses.                                                                   
                                                                                
    BOUNDARY CHANGES                                                            
                                                                                
    The boundaries of some counties, county subdivisions, American Indian       
    and Alaska Native areas, and many incorporated places, changed              
    between those reported for the 1980 census and January 1, 1990.             
    Boundary changes to legal entities result from:                             
                                                                                
      1. Annexations to or detachments from legally established                 
         governmental units.                                                    
                                                                                
      2. Mergers or consolidations of two or more governmental units.           
                                                                                
      3. Establishment of new governmental units.                               
                                                                                
      4. Disincorporations or disorganizations of existing governmental         
         units.                                                                 
                                                                                
      5. Changes in treaties and Executive Orders.                              
                                                                                
    The historical counts shown for counties, county subdivisions, and          
    places are not updated for such changes, and thus reflect the               
    population and housing units in the area as delineated at each              
    census.  Information on boundary changes reported between the 1980          
    and 1990 censuses for counties, county subdivisions, and incorporated       
    places is presented in the "User Notes" section of the technical            
    documentation of Summary Tape Files 1 and 3, and in the 1990 CPH-2,         
    Population and Housing Unit Counts printed reports.  For information        
    on boundary changes for such areas in the decade preceding other            
    decennial censuses, see the Number of Inhabitants reports for each          
    census.  Boundary changes are not reported for some areas, such as          
    census designated places and block groups.

    Census divisions are groupings of States that are subdivisions of the       
    four census regions.  There are nine divisions, which the Census            
    Bureau adopted in 1910 for the presentation of data.  The regions,          
    divisions, and their constituent States are:

    Census regions are groupings of States that subdivide the United            
    States for the presentation of data.  There are four                        
    regions-Northeast, Midwest, South, and West.  Each of the four census       
    regions is divided into two or more census divisions.  Prior to 1984,       
    the Midwest region was named the North Central region.  From 1910,          
    when census regions were established, through the 1940's, there were

    CENSUS TRACT AND BLOCK NUMBERING AREA                                       
                                                                                
    BLOCK NUMBERING AREA (BNA)                                                  
                                                                                
    Block numbering areas (BNA's) are small statistical subdivisions of a       
    county for grouping and numbering blocks in nonmetropolitan counties        
    where local census statistical areas committees have not established        
    census tracts.  State agencies and the Census Bureau delineated BNA's       
    for the 1990 census, using guidelines similar to those for the              
    delineation of census tracts.  BNA's do not cross county boundaries.        
                                                                                
    BNA's are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a            
    two-digit suffix; for example, 9901.07.  The decimal point separating       
    the four-digit basic BNA number from the two-digit suffix is shown in       
    printed reports, in microfiche, and on census maps; in                      
    machine-readable files, the decimal point is implied.  Many BNA's do        
    not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is left blank in         
    all data products.  BNA numbers range from 9501 through 9989.99, and        
    are unique within a county (numbers in the range of 0001 through            
    9499.99 denote a census tract).  The suffix .99 identifies a BNA that       
    was populated entirely by persons aboard one or more civilian or            
    military ships.  A "crews-of-vessels" BNA appears on census maps only       
    as an anchor symbol with its BNA number (and block numbers on maps          
    showing block numbers); the BNA relates to the ships associated with        
    the onshore BNA's having the same four-digit basic number.  Suffixes        
    in the range .80 through .98 usually identify BNA's that either were        
    revised or were created during the 1990 census data collection              
    activities.  Some of these revisions produced BNA's that have               
    extremely small land area and may have little or no population or           
    housing.  For data analysis, such a BNA can be summarized with an           
    adjacent BNA.                                                               
                                                                                
    CENSUS TRACT                                                                
                                                                                
    Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical                   
    subdivisions of a county.  Census tracts are delineated for all             
    metropolitan areas (MA's) and other densely populated counties by           
    local census statistical areas committees following Census Bureau           
    guidelines (more than 3,000 census tracts have been established in          
    221 counties outside MA's).  Six States (California, Connecticut,           
    Delaware, Hawaii, New Jersey, and Rhode Island) and the District of         
    Columbia are covered entirety by census tracts.  Census tracts              
    usually have between 2,500 and 8,000 persons and, when first                
    delineated, are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population       
    characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  Census            
    tracts do not cross county boundaries.  The spatial size of census          
    tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Census        
    tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being                 
    maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be

    made from census to census.  However, physical changes in street            
    patterns caused by highway construction, new development, etc., may         
    require occasional revisions; census tracts occasionally are split          
    due to large population growth, or combined as a result of                  
    substantial population decline.  Census tracts are referred to as           
    "tracts" in all 1990 data products.                                         
                                                                                
    Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may           
    have a two-digit suffix; for example, 6059.02.  The decimal point           
    separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit             
    suffix is shown in printed reports, in microfiche, and on census            
    maps; in machine-readable files, the decimal point is implied.  Many        
    census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field         
    is left blank in all data products.  Leading zeros in a census tract        
    number (for example, 002502) are shown only on machine-readable             
    files.                                                                      
                                                                                
    Census tract numbers range from 0001 through 9499.99 and are unique         
    within a county (numbers in the range of 9501 through 9989.99 denote        
    a block numbering area).  The suffix .99 identifies a census tract          
    that was populated entirely by persons aboard one or more civilian or       
    military ships.  A "crews-of-vessels" census tract appears on census        
    maps only as an anchor symbol with its census tract number (and block       
    numbers on maps showing block numbers).  These census tracts relate         
    to the ships associated with the on-shore census tract having the           
    same four-digit basic number.  Suffixes in the range .80 through .98        
    usually identify census tracts that either were revised or were             
    created during the 1990 census data collection activities.  Some of         
    these revisions may have resulted in census tracts that have                
    extremely small land area and may have little or no population or           
    housing.  For data analysis, such a census tract can be summarized          
    with an adjacent census tract.                                              
                                                                                
    CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT (CD)                                                 
                                                                                
    Congressional districts (CD's) are the 435 areas from which persons         
    are elected to the U.S.  House of Representatives.  After the               
    apportionment of congressional seats among the States, based on             
    census population counts, each State is responsible for establishing        
    CD's for the purpose of electing representatives.  Each CD is to be         
    as equal in population to all other CD's in the State as practicable,       
    based on the decennial census counts.                                       
                                                                                
    The CD's that were in effect on January 1, 1990 were those of the           
    101st Congress.  Data on the 101st Congress appear in an early 1990         
    census data product (Summary Tape File 1A).  The CD's of the 101st          
    Congress are the same as those in effect for the 102nd Congress.            
    CD's of the 103rd Congress, reflecting redistricting based on the           
    1990 census, are summarized in later 1990 data products (STF's 1D and       
    3D, and 1990 CPH-4, Population and Housing Characteristics for              
    Congressional Districts of the 103rd Congress printed reports).

    The primary political divisions of most States are termed "counties."       
    In Louisiana, these divisions are known as "parishes."  In Alaska,          
    which has no counties, the county equivalents are the organized             
    "boroughs" and the "census areas" that are delineated for statistical       
    purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.  In four             
    States (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or         
    more cities that are independent of any county organization and thus        
    constitute primary divisions of their States.  These cities are known       
    as "independent cities" and are treated as equivalent to counties for       
    statistical purposes.  That part of Yellowstone National Park in            
    Montana is treated as a county equivalent.  The District of Columbia        
    has no primary divisions, and the entire area is considered                 
    equivalent to a county for statistical purposes.                            
                                                                                
    Each county and county equivalent is assigned a three-digit FIPS code       
    that is unique within State.  These codes are assigned in                   
    alphabetical order of county or county equivalent within State,             
    except for the independent cities, which follow the listing of              
    counties.                                                                   
                                                                                
    COUNTY SUBDIVISION                                                          
                                                                                
    County subdivisions are the primary subdivisions of counties and            
    their equivalents for the reporting of decennial census data.  They         
    include census county divisions, census subareas, minor civil               
    divisions, and unorganized territories.                                     
                                                                                
    Each county subdivision is assigned a three-digit census code in            
    alphabetical order within county and a five-digit FIPS code in              
    alphabetical order within State.                                            
                                                                                
    CENSUS COUNTY DIVISION (CCD)                                                
                                                                                
    Census county divisions (CCD's) are subdivisions of a county that           
    were delineated by the Census Bureau, in cooperation with State             
    officials and local census statistical areas committees, for                
    statistical purposes.  CCD's were established in 21 States where            
    there are no legally established minor civil divisions (MCD's), where       
    the MCD's do not have governmental or administrative purposes, where        
    the boundaries of the MCD's change frequently, and/or where the MCD's       
    are not generally known to the public.  CCD's have no legal f               
    unctions, and are not governmental units.                                   
                                                                                
    The boundaries of CCD's usually are delineated to follow visible            
    features, and in most cases coincide with census tract or block             
    numbering area boundaries.  The name of each CCD is based on a place,       
    county, or well-known local name that identifies its location.  CCD's       
    have been established in the following 21 States: Alabama, Arizona,         
    California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho,

    Kentucky, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South              
    Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.  For the         
    1980 census, the county subdivisions recognized for Nevada were             
    MCD's.                                                                      
                                                                                
    CENSUS SUBAREA (ALASKA)                                                     
                                                                                
    Census subareas are statistical subdivisions of boroughs and census         
    areas (county equivalents) in Alaska.  Census subareas were                 
    delineated cooperatively by the State of Alaska and the Census              
    Bureau.  The census subareas, identified first in 1980, replaced the        
    various types of subdivisions used in the 1970 census.                      
                                                                                
    MINOR CIVIL DIVISION (MCD)                                                  
                                                                                
    Minor civil divisions (MCD's) are the primary political or                  
    administrative divisions of a county.  MCD's represent many different       
    kinds of legal entities with a wide variety of governmental and/or          
    administrative functions.  MCD's are variously designated as American       
    Indian reservations, assessment districts, boroughs, election               
    districts, gores, grants, magisterial districts, parish governing           
    authority districts, plantations, precincts, purchases, supervisors'        
    districts, towns, and townships.  In some States, all or some               
    incorporated places are not located in any MCD and thus serve as            
    MCD's in their own right.  In other States, incorporated places are         
    subordinate to (part of the MCD's in which they are located, or the         
    pattern is mixed-some incorporated places are independent of MCD's          
    and others are subordinate to one or more MCD's.                            
                                                                                
    The Census Bureau recognizes MCD's in the following 28 States:              
    Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana,          
    Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,           
    Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North              
    Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South             
    Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.  The               
    District of Columbia has no primary divisions, and the entire area is       
    considered equivalent to an MCD for statistical purposes.  The MCD's        
    in 12 selected States (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan,         
    Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode         
    Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin) also serve as general-purpose local         
    governments.  The Census Bureau presents data for these MCD's in all        
    data products in which it provides data for places.                         
                                                                                
    UNORGANIZED TERRITORY (UNORG.)                                              
                                                                                
    In nine States (Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota,        
    North Carolina, North Dakota, and South Dakota), some counties              
    contain territory that is not included in an MCD recognized by the          
    Census Bureau.  Each separate area of unorganized territory in these        
    States is recognized as one or more separate county subdivisions for        
    census purposes.  Each unorganized territory is given a descriptive

    GEOGRAPHIC CODE                                                             
                                                                                
    Geographic codes are shown primarily on machine-readable data               
    products, such as computer tape and compact disc-read only memory           
    (CD-ROM), but also appear on other products such as microfiche; they        
    also are shown on some census maps.  Codes are identified as "census        
    codes" only if there is also a Federal Information Processing               
    Standards (FIPS) code for the same geographic entity.  A code that is       
    not identified as either "census" or "FIPS" is usually a census code        
    for which there is no FIPS equivalent, for for which the Census             
    Bureau does not Lise the FIPS code.  The exceptions, which use only         
    the FIPS code in census products, are county, congressional district,       
    and metropolitan area (that is, metropolitan statistical area,              
    consolidated metropolitan statistical area, and primary metropolitan        
    statistical area).                                                          
                                                                                
    CENSUS CODE                                                                 
                                                                                
    Census codes are assigned for a variety of geographic entities,             
    including American Indian and Alaska Native area, census division,          
    census region, county subdivision, place, State, urbanized area, and        
    voting district.  The structure, format, and meaning of census codes        
    appear in the 1990 census Geographic Identification Code Scheme, in         
    the data dictionary portion of the technical documentation for              
    summary tape files, CD-ROM's, and microfiche.                               
                                                                                
    FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARDS (FIPS) CODE                        
                                                                                
    Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes are assigned          
    for a variety of geographic entities, including American Indian and         
    Alaska Native area, congressional district, county, county                  
    subdivision, metropolitan area, place, and State.  The structure,           
    format, and meaning of FIPS codes used in the census are shown in the       
    1990 census Geographic Identification Code Scheme; in the data              
    dictionary portion of the technical documentation for summary tape

    The objective of the FIPS codes is to improve the use of data               
    resources of the Federal Government and avoid unnecessary duplication       
    and incompatibilities in the collection, processing, and                    
    dissemination of data.  More information about FIPS and FIPS code           
    documentation is available from the National Technical Information          
    Service, Springfield, VA 22161.

    depicted in report tables by means of indentation, and is explained         
    for machine-readable media in the discussion of file Structure in the       
    geographic coverage portion of the abstract in the technical                
    documentation.  An example of hierarchical presentation is the              
    "standard census geographic hierarchy": block, within block group,          
    within census tract or block numbering area, within place, within           
    county subdivision, within county, within State, within division,           
    within region, within the United States.  Graphically, this is shown

    INVENTORY PRESENTATION                                                      
                                                                                
    An inventory presentation of geographic entities is one in which all        
    entities of the same type are shown in alphabetical or code sequence,       
    without reference to their hierarchical relationships.  Generally, an       
    inventory presentation shows totals for entities that may be split in       
    a hierarchical presentation, such as place, census tract/block              
    numbering area, or block group.  An example of a series of inventory        
    presentations is: State, followed by all the counties in that State,        
    followed by all the places in that State.  Graphically, this is shown       
    as:

    HISTORICAL COUNTS                                                           
                                                                                
    Historical counts for total population and total housing units are          
    shown in the 1990 CPH-2, Population and Housing Unit Counts report          
    series.  As in past censuses, the general rule for presenting               
    historical data for States, counties, county subdivisions, and places       
    is to show historical counts only for single, continually existing          
    entities.  Stated another way, if an entity existed for both the            
    current and preceding censuses, the tables show counts for the              
    preceding censuses.  Included in this category are entities of the          
    same type (county, county subdivision, place) even if they had              
    changed their names.  Also included are entities that merged, but           
    only if the new entity retained the name of one of the merged               
    entities.  The historical counts shown are for each entity as it was        
    bounded at each census.                                                     
                                                                                
    In cases where an entity was formed since a preceding census, such as       
    a newly incorporated place or a newly organized township, the symbol        
    three dots "..."  is shown for earlier censuses.  The three-dot             
    symbol also is shown for those parts of a place that have extended          
    into an additional county or county subdivision through annexation or       
    other revision of boundaries since the preceding census.                    
                                                                                
    In a few cases, changes in the boundaries of county subdivisions            
    caused a place to be split into two or more parts, or to be split           
    differently than in the preceding census.  If historical counts for         
    the parts of the place as currently split did not appear in a               
    preceding census, "(NA)" is shown for the place in each county              
    subdivision; however, the historical population and housing unit            
    counts of the place appear in tables that show the entire place.  For       
    counties, county subdivisions, and places formed since January 1,           
    1980, 1980 census population and housing unit counts in the 1990            
    territory are reported in the geographic change notes included in the       
    "User Notes" text section of 1990 CPH-2, Population and Housing Unit        
    Counts, and in the technical documentation of Summary Tape Files 1          
    and 3.                                                                      
                                                                                
    In some cases, population and housing unit counts for individual            
    areas were revised since publication of the 1980 reports (indicated         
    by the prefix "F").  In a number of tables of 1990 CPH-2, Population        
    and Housing Unit Counts, 1980 counts are shown for aggregations of          
    individual areas, such as the number, population, and housing unit          
    counts of places in size groups, or urban and rural distributions.          
    Revisions of population and housing unit counts for individual areas        
    were not applied to the various aggregations.  Therefore, it may not        
    be possible to determine the individual areas in a given aggregation        
    using the historical counts; conversely, the sum of the counts shown        
    for individual areas may not agree with the aggregation.

    An internal point is a set of geographic coordinates (latitude and          
    longitude) that is located within a specified geographic entity.  A         
    single point is identified for each entity; for many entities, this         
    point represents the approximate geographic center of that entity.          
    If the shape of the entity caused this point to be located outside          
    the boundaries of the entity, it is relocated from the center so that       
    it is within the entity.  If the internal point for a block falls in        
    a water area, it is relocated to a land area within the block.  On          
    machine-readable products, internal points are shown to six decimal         
    places; the decimal point is implied.                                       
                                                                                
    METROPOLITAN AREA                                                           
                                                                                
    The general concept of a metropolitan area (MA) is one of a large           
    population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that have a          
    high degree of economic and social integration with that nucleus.           
    Some MA's are defined around two or more nuclei.                            
                                                                                
    The MA classification is a statistical standard, developed for use by       
    Federal agencies in the production, analysis, and publication of data       
    on MA's.  The MA's are designated and defined by the Federal Office         
    of Management and Budget, following a set of official published             
    standards.  These standards were developed by the interagency Federal       
    Executive Committee on Metropolitan Areas, with the aim of producing        
    definitions that are as consistent as possible for all MA's                 
    nationwide.                                                                 
                                                                                
    Each MA must contain either a place with a minimum population of            
    50,000 or a Census Bureau-defined urbanized area and a total MA             
    population of at least 100,000 (75,000 in New England).  An MA              
    comprises one or more central counties.  An MA also may include one         
    or more outlying counties that have close economic and social               
    relationships with the central county.  An outlying county must have        
    a specified level of commuting to the central counties and also must        
    meet certain standards regarding metropolitan character, such as            
    population density, urban population, and population growth.  In New        
    England MA's are composed of cities and towns rather than whole             
    counties.                                                                   
                                                                                
    The territory, population, and housing units in MA's are referred to        
    as "metropolitan."  The metropolitan category is subdivided into            
    "inside central city" and "outside central city."  The territory,           
    population, and housing units located outside MA's are referred to as       
    "nonmetropolitan."  The metropolitan and nonmetropolitan                    
    classification cuts across the other hierarchies; for example, there        
    is generally both urban and rural territory within both metropolitan        
    and nonmetropolitan areas.                                                  
                                                                                
    To meet the needs of various users, the standards provide for a             
    flexible structure of metropolitan definitions that classify an MA          
    either as a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), or as a consolidated

    Division, U.S.  Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233.                 
                                                                                
    CENTRAL CITY                                                                
                                                                                
    In each MSA and CMSA, the largest place and, in some cases,                 
    additional places are designated as "central cities" under the              
    official standards.  A few PMSA's do not have central cities, The           
    largest central city and, in some cases, up to two additional central       
    cities are included in the title of the MA; there also are central          
    cities that are not included in an MA title.  An MA central city does       
    not include any part of that city that extends outside the MA               
    boundary.                                                                   
                                                                                
    CONSOLIDATED AND PRIMARY METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA (CMSA AND            
    PMSA)                                                                       
                                                                                
    If an area that qualifies as an MA has more than one million persons,       
    primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSA's) may be defined within       
    it.  PMSA's consist of a large urbanized county or cluster of               
    counties that demonstrates very strong internal economic and social         
    links, in addition to close ties to other portions of the larger            
    area.  When PMSA's are established, the larger area of which they are       
    component parts is designated a consolidated metropolitan statistical       
    area (CMSA).                                                                
                                                                                
    METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA (MSA)                                         
                                                                                
    Metropolitan statistical areas (MSA's) are relatively freestanding          
    MA's and are not closely associated with other MA's.  These areas           
    typically are surrounded by nonmetropolitan counties.                       
                                                                                
    METROPOLITAN AREA TITLE AND CODE                                            
                                                                                
    The title of an MSA contains the name of its largest central city,          
    and up to two additional city names, provided that the additional           
    places meet specified levels of population, employment, and                 
    commuting.  Generally, a city with a population of 250,000 or more is       
    in the title, regardless of other criteria.                                 
                                                                                
    The title of a PMSA may contain up to three place names, as                 
    determined above, or up to three county names, sequenced in order of        
    population.  A CMSA title also may include up to three names, the           
    first of which generally is the most populous central city in the           
    area.  The second name may be the first city or county name in the          
    most populous remaining PMSA; the third name may be the first city or       
    county name in the next most populous PMSA.  A regional designation         
    may be substituted for the second and/or third names in a CMSA title

    if such a designation is supported by local opinion and is deemed to        
    be unambiguous and suitable by the Office of Management and Budget.         
                                                                                
    The titles for all MA's also contain the name of each State in which        
    the area is located.  Each metropolitan area is assigned a four-digit       
    FIPS code, in alphabetical order nationwide.  If the fourth digit of        
    the code is a "2," it identifies a CMSA.  Additionally, there is a          
    separate set of two-digit codes for CMSA's, also assigned                   
    alphabetically.                                                             
                                                                                
    OUTLYING AREAS OF THE UNITED STATES                                         
                                                                                
    The Census Bureau treats the outlying areas as the statistical              
    equivalents of States for the 1990 census.  The outlying areas are          
    American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands          
    (Northern Mariana Islands), Republic of Palau (Palau), Puerto Rico,         
    and the Virgin Islands of the United States. (Virgin Islands)               
    Geographic definitions specific to each outlying area are shown in          
    appendix A of the text in the data products for each area.                  
                                                                                
    PLACE                                                                       
                                                                                
    Places, for the reporting of decennial census data, include census          
    designated places and incorporated places.  Each place is assigned a        
    four-digit census code that is unique within State.  Each place is          
    also assigned a five-digit FIPS code that is unique within State.           
    Both the census and FIPS codes are assigned based on alphabetical           
    order within State.  Consolidated cities (see below) are assigned a         
    one-character alphabetical census code that is unique nationwide and        
    a five-digit FIPS code that is unique within State.                         
                                                                                
    CENSUS DESIGNATED PLACE (CDP)                                               
                                                                                
    Census designated places (CDP's) are delineated for the decennial           
    census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDP's       
    comprise densely settled concentrations of population that are              
    identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated places.  Their       
    boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the             
    boundary of an adjacent incorporated place, have no legal status, nor       
    do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal       
    functions.  CDP boundaries may change with changes in the settlement        
    pattern; a CDP with the same name as in previous censuses does not          
    necessarily have the same boundaries.                                       
                                                                                
    Beginning with the 1950 census, the Census Bureau, in cooperation           
    with State agencies and local census statistical areas committees,          
    has identified and delineated boundaries for CDP's.  In the 1990            
    census, the name of each such place is followed by "CDP."  In the           
    1980 census, "(CDP)" was used; in 1970, 1960, and 1950 censuses,            
    these places were identified by "(U)," meaning "unincorporated              
    place."

    To qualify as a CDP for the 1990 census, an unincorporated community        
    must have met the following criteria:                                       
                                                                                
        1.  In all States except Alaska and Hawaii, the Census Bureau           
            uses three population size criteria to designate a CDP. These       
            criteria are:                                                       
                                                                                
            a.  1,000 or more persons if outside the boundaries of an           
                urbanized area (UA) delineated for the 1980 census or a         
                subsequent special census.                                      
                                                                                
            b.  2,500 or more persons if inside the boundaries of a UA          
                delineated for the 1980 census or a subsequent special          
                census.                                                         
                                                                                
            c.  250 or more persons if outside the boundaries of a UA           
                delineated for the 1980 census or a subsequent special          
                census, and within the official boundaries of an American       
                Indian reservation recognized for the 1990 census.              
                                                                                
        2.  In Alaska, 25 or more persons if outside a UA, and 2,500 or         
            more persons if inside a UA delineated for the 1980 census or       
            a subsequent special census.                                        
                                                                                
        3.  In Hawaii, 300 or more persons, regardless of whether the           
            community is inside or outside a UA.                                
                                                                                
    For the 1990 census, CDP's qualified on the basis of the population         
    counts prepared for the 1990 Postcensus Local Review Program.               
    Because these counts were subject to change, a few CDP's may have           
    final population counts lower than the minimums shown above.                
                                                                                
    Hawaii is the only State with no incorporated places recognized by          
    the Bureau of the Census.  All places shown for Hawaii in the data          
    products are CDP's.  By agreement with the State of Hawaii, the             
    Census Bureau does not show data separately for the city of Honolulu.       
    which is coextensive with Honolulu County.                                  
                                                                                
    CONSOLIDATED CITY                                                           
                                                                                
    A consolidated government is a unit of local government for which the       
    functions of an incorporated place and its county or minor civil            
    division (MCD) have merged.  The legal aspects of this action may           
    result in both the primary incorporated place and the county or MCD         
    continuing to exist as legal entities, even though the county or MCD        
    performs few or no governmental functions and has few or no elected         
    officials.  Where this occurs, and where one or more other                  
    incorporated places in the county or MCD continue to function as            
    separate governments, even though they have been included in the

    The data presentation for consolidated cities varies depending upon         
    the geographic presentation.  In hierarchical presentations,                
    consolidated cities are not shown.  These presentations include the         
    semi-independent places and the "consolidated city (remainder)."            
    Where the consolidated city is coextensive with a county or county          
    subdivision, the data shown for those areas in hierarchical                 
    presentations are equivalent to those for the consolidated                  
    government.                                                                 
                                                                                
    For inventory geographic presentations, the consolidated city appears       
    at the end of the listing of places.  The data for the consolidated         
    city include places that are part of the consolidated city.  The            
    "consolidated city (remainder)" is the portion of the consolidated          
    government minus the semi-independent places, and is shown in               
    alphabetical sequence with other places.                                    
                                                                                
    In summary presentations by size of place, the consolidated city is         
    not included.  The places semi-independent of consolidated cities are       
    categorized by their size, as is the "consolidated city (remainder)."       
                                                                                
    Each consolidated city is assigned a one-character alphabetic census        
    code.  Each consolidated city also is assigned a five-digit FIPS code       
    that is unique within State.  The semi-independent places and the           
    "consolidated city (remainder)" are assigned a f our-digit census           
    code and a five-digit FIPS place code that are unique within State.         
    Both the census and FIPS codes are assigned based on alphabetical           
    order within State.

    Incorporated places recognized in 1990 census data products are those       
    reported to the Census Bureau as legally in existence on January 1,         
    1990 under the laws of their respective States as cities, boroughs,         
    towns, and villages, with the following exceptions: the towns in the        
    New England States, New York, and Wisconsin, and the boroughs in New        
    York are recognized as minor civil divisions for census purposes; the       
    boroughs in Alaska are county equivalents.

    Population or housing unit density is computed by dividing the total        
    population or housing units of a geographic unit (for example, United       
    States, State, county, place) by its land area measured in square           
    kilometers or square miles.  Density is expressed as both "persons          
    (or housing units) per square kilometer" and "persons (or housing           
    units) per square mile" of land area in 1990 census printed reports.

    State for census purposes.  The four census regions, nine census            
    divisions, and their component States are shown under "CENSUS REGION        
    AND CENSUS DIVISION" in this appendix.                                      
                                                                                
    The Census Bureau treats the outlying areas as State equivalents for        
    the 1990 census.  The outlying areas are American Samoa, Guam, the          
    Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands        
    of the United States.  Geographic definitions specific to each              
    outlying area are shown in appendix A in the data products for each         
    area.                                                                       
                                                                                
    Each State and equivalent is assigned a two-digit numeric Federal           
    Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in alphabetical order by       
    State name, followed by the outlying area names.  Each State and            
    equivalent area also is assigned a two-digit census code.  This code        
    is assigned on the basis of the geographic sequence of each State           
    within each census division; the first digit of the code is the code        
    for the respective division.  Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and          
    the outlying areas of the Pacific are assigned "O" as the division          
    code.  Each State and equivalent area also is assigned the two-letter       
    FIPS/ United States Postal Service (USPS) code.                             
                                                                                
    In 12 selected States (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan,         
    Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode         
    Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin), the minor civil divisions also serve       
    as general-purpose local governments.  The Census Bureau presents           
    data for these minor civil divisions in all data products in which it       
    provides data for places.

    TIGER is an acronym for the new digital (computer-readable)                 
    geographic data base that automates the mapping and related                 
    geographic activities required to support the Census Bureau's census        
    and survey programs.  The Census Bureau developed the Topologically         
    Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) System to            
    automate the geographic support processes needed to meet the major          
    geographic needs of the 1990 census: producing the cartographic             
    products to support data collection and map publication, providing          
    the geographic structure for tabulation and publication of the              
    collected data, assigning residential and employer addresses to their       
    geographic location and relating those locations to the Census              
    Bureau's geographic units, and so forth.  The content of the TIGER          
    data base is made available to the public through a variety of "TIGER       
    Extract" files that may be obtained from the Data User Services

    URBAN AND RURAL                                                             
                                                                                
    The Census Bureau defines "urban" for the 1990 census as comprising         
    all territory, population, and housing units in urbanized areas and         
    in places of 2,500 or more persons outside urbanized areas, More            
    specifically, "urban" consists of territory, persons, and housing           
    units in:                                                                   
                                                                                
        1.  Places of 2,500 or more persons incorporated as cities,             
            villages, boroughs (except in Alaska and New York), and towns       
            (except in the six (New England States, New York, and               
            Wisconsin), but excluding the rural portions of "extended           
            cities."                                                            
                                                                                
        2.  Census designated places of 2,500 or more persons.                  
                                                                                
        3.  Other territory, incorporated or unincorporated, included in        
            urbanized areas.                                                    
                                                                                
    Territory, population, and housing units not classified as urban            
    constitute "rural."  In the 100-percent data products, "rural" is           
    divided into "places of less than 2,500" and "not in places."  The          
    "not in places" category comprises "rural" outside incorporated and         
    census designated places and the rural portions of extended cities.         
    In many data products, the term "other rural" is used; "other rural"        
    is a residual category specific to the classification of the rural in       
    each data product.                                                          
                                                                                
    In the sample data products, rural population and housing units are         
    subdivided into "rural farm" and "rural nonfarm."  "Rural farm"             
    comprises all rural households and housing units on farms (places           
    from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products were sold in             
    1989); "rural nonfarm" comprises the remaining rural.                       
                                                                                
    The urban and rural classification cuts across the other hierarchies;       
    for example, there is generally both urban and rural territory within       
    both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas.                                
                                                                                
    In censuses prior to 1950, "urban" comprised all territory, persons,        
    and housing units in incorporated places of 2,500 or more persons,          
    and in areas (usually minor civil divisions) classified as urban            
    under special rules relating to population size and density.  The           
    definition of urban that restricted itself to incorporated places           
    having 2,500 or more persons excluded many large, densely settled           
    areas merely because they were not incorporated.  Prior to the 1950         
    census, the Census Bureau attempted to avoid some of the more obvious

    omissions by classifying selected areas as "urban under special             
    rules."  Even with these rules, however, many large, closely built-up       
    areas were excluded from the urban category.                                
                                                                                
    To improve its measure of urban territory, population, and housing          
    units, the Census Bureau adopted the concept of the urbanized area          
    and delineated boundaries for unincorporated places (now, census            
    designated places) for the 1950 census.  Urban was defined as               
    territory, persons, and housing units in urbanized areas and, outside       
    urbanized areas, in all places, incorporated or unincorporated, that        
    had 2,500 or more persons.  With the following three exceptions, the        
    1950 census definition of urban has continued substantially                 
    unchanged.  First, in the 1960 census (but not in the 1970, 1980, or        
    1990 censuses), certain towns in the New England States, townships in       
    New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and Arlington County, Virginia, were           
    designated as urban.  However, most of these "special rule" areas           
    would have been classified as urban anyway because they were included       
    in an urbanized area or in an unincorporated place of 2,500 or more         
    persons.  Second, "extended cities" were identified for the 1970,           
    1980, and 1990 censuses.  Extended cities primarily affect the              
    figures for urban and rural territory (area), but have very little          
    effect on the urban and rural population and housing units at the           
    national and State levels although for some individual counties and         
    urbanized areas, the effects have been more evident.  Third, changes        
    since the 1970 census in the criteria for defining urbanized areas          
    have permitted these areas to be defined around smaller centers.            
                                                                                
    Documentation of the urbanized area and extended city criteria is           
    available from the Chief, Geography Division, U.S.  Bureau of the           
    Census, Washington, DC 20233.                                               
                                                                                
    EXTENDED CITY                                                               
                                                                                
    Since the 1960 census, there has been a trend in some States toward         
    the extension of city boundaries to include territory that is               
    essentially rural in character.  The classification of all the              
    population and living quarters of such places as urban would include        
    in the urban designation territory, persons, and housing units whose        
    environment is primarily rural.  For the 1970,1980, and 1990                
    censuses, the Census Bureau identified as rural such territory and          
    its population and housing units for each extended city whose closely       
    settled area was located in an urbanized area.  For the 1990 census,        
    this classification also has been applied to certain places outside         
    urbanized areas.                                                            
                                                                                
    In summary presentations by size of place, the urban portion of an          
    extended city is classified by the population of the entire place;          
    the rural portion is included in "other rural."                             
                                                                                
    URBANIZED AREA (UA)

    The Census Bureau delineates urbanized areas (UA's) to provide a            
    better separation of urban and rural territory, population, and             
    housing in the vicinity of large places.  A UA comprises one or more        
    places ("central place") and the adjacent densely settled surrounding       
    territory ("urban fringe") that together have a minimum of 50,000           
    persons.  The urban fringe generally consists of contiguous territory       
    having a density of least 1,000 persons per square mile.  The urban         
    fringe also includes outlying territory of such density if it was           
    connected to the core of the contiguous area by road and is within 1        
    1/2 road miles of that core, or within 5 road miles of the core but         
    separated by water or other undevelopable territory.  Other territory       
    with a population density of fewer than 1,000 people per square mile        
    is included in the urban fringe if it eliminates an enclave or closes       
    an indentation in the boundary of the urbanized area.  The population       
    density is determined by (1) outside of a place, one or more                
    contiguous census blocks with a population density of at least 1,000        
    persons per square mile or (2) inclusion of a place containing census       
    blocks that have at least 50 percent of the population of the place         
    and a density of at least 1,000 persons per square mile.  The               
    complete criteria are available from the Chief, Geography Division,         
    U.S.  Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233.                           
                                                                                
    URBANIZED AREA CENTRAL PLACE                                                
                                                                                
    One or more central places function as the dominant centers of each         
    UA.  The identification of a UA central place permits the comparison        
    of this dominant center with the remaining territory in the UA.             
    There is no limit on the number of central places, and not all              
    central places are necessarily included in the UA title.  UA central        
    places include:                                                             
                                                                                
        1.  Each place entirely (or partially, if the place is an               
            extended city) within the UA that is a central city of a            
            metropolitan area (MA).                                             
                                                                                
        2.  If the UA does not contain an MA central city or is located         
            outside of an MA, the central place(s) is determined by             
            population size.                                                    
                                                                                
    URBANIZED AREA TITLE AND CODE                                               
                                                                                
    The title of a UA identifies those places that are most important           
    within the UA; it links the UA to the encompassing MA, where                
    appropriate.  If a single MA includes most of the UA, the title and         
    code of the UA generally are the same as the title and code of the          
    MA.  If the UA is not mostly included in a single MA, if it does not        
    include any place that is a central city of the encompassing MA, or         
    if it is not located in an MA, the Census Bureau uses the population        
    size of the included places, with a preference for incorporated             
    places, to determine the UA title.  The name of each State in which         
    the UA is located also is in each UA title.                                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      Page 164                                          ICPSR 9952              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    The numeric code used to identity each UA is the same as the code for       
    the mostly encompassing MA (including CMSA and PMSA).  If MA title          
    cities represent multiple UA's, or the UA title city does not               
    correspond to the first name of an MA title, the Census Bureau              
    assigns a code based on the alphabetical sequence of the UA title in        
    relationship to the other UA and MA titles.                                 
                                                                                
    VOTING DISTRICT (VTD)                                                       
                                                                                
    A voting district (VTD) is any of a variety of types of areas (for          
    example, election districts, precincts, wards, legislative districts)       
    established by State and local governments for purposes of elections.       
    For census purposes, each State participating in Phase 2 of the 1990        
    Census Redistricting Data Program outlined the boundaries of VTD's          
    around groups of whole census blocks on census maps.  The entities          
    identified as VTD's are not necessarily those legally or currently          
    established Also, to meet the "whole block" criterion, a State may          
    have had to adjust VTD boundaries to nearby block boundaries.               
    Therefore, the VTD's shown on the 1990 census tapes, listings, and          
    maps may not represent the actual VTD's in effect at the time of the        
    census.  In the 1980 census, VTD's were referred to as "election            
    precincts."                                                                 
                                                                                
    Each VTD is assigned a four-character alphanumeric code that is             
    unique within each county.  The code "ZZZZ" is assigned to                  
    nonparticipating areas; the Census Bureau reports data for areas            
    coded "ZZZZ."                                                               
                                                                                
    ZIP CODE                                                                    
                                                                                
    ZIP Codes are administrative units established by the United States         
    Postal Service (USPS) for the distribution of mail.  ZIP Codes serve        
    addresses for the most efficient delivery of mail, and therefore            
    generally do not respect political or census statistical area               
    boundaries.  ZIP Codes usually do not have clearly identifiable             
    boundaries, often serve a continually changing area are changed             
    periodically to meet postal requirements, and do not cover all the          
    land area of the United States.  ZIP Codes are identified by                
    five-digit codes assigned by the USPS.  The first three digits              
    identify a major city or sectional distribution center, and the last

    AGE                                                                         
                                                                                
    The data on age were derived from answers to questionnaire item 5,          
    which was asked of all persons. The age classification is based on          
    the age of the person in complete years as of April 1, 1990. The age        
    response in question 5a was used normally to represent a person's           
    age. However, when the age response was unacceptable or unavailable,        
    a person's age was derived from an acceptable year-of-birth response        
    in question 5b.                                                             
                                                                                
    Data on age are used to determine the applicability of other                
    questions for a person and to classify other characteristics in             
    census tabulations. Age data are needed to interpret most social and        
    economic characteristics used to plan and examine many programs and         
    policies. Therefore, age is tabulated by single years of age and by         
    marry different groupings, such as 5-year age groups.                       
                                                                                
    Some tabulations are shown by the age of the householder. These data        
    were derived from the age responses for each householder. (For more         
    information on householder, see the discussion under "Household Type        
    and Relationship.")                                                         
                                                                                
    Median Age-This measure divides the age distribution into two equal         
    parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median value and             
    one-half above the value. Generally, median age is computed on the          
    basis of more detailed age intervals than are shown in some census          
    publications; thus, a median based on a less detailed distribution          
    may differ slightly from a corresponding median for the same                
    population based on a more detailed distribution. (For more                 
    information on medians, see the discussion under "Derived Measures.")       
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data - Counts in 1970 and 1980 for persons 100            
    years old and over were substantially overstated. Improvements were         
    made in the questionnaire design, in the allocation procedures, and         
    to the respondent instruction guide to attempt to minimize this             
    problem for the 1990 census.                                                
                                                                                
    Review of detailed 1990 census information indicated that respondents       
    tended to provide their age as of the date of completion of the             
    questionnaire, not their age as of April 1, 1990. In addition, there        
    may have been a tendency for respondents to round their age up if           
    they were close to having a birthday. It is likely that approximately       
    10 percent of persons in most age groups are actually 1 year younger.       
    For most single years of age, the misstatements are largely                 
    offsetting. The problem is most pronounced at age 0 because persons         
    lost to age 1 may not have been fully offset by the inclusion of            
    babies born after April 1, 1990 and because there may have been more        
    rounding up to age 1 to avoid reporting age as 0 years. (Age in             
    complete months was not collected for infants under age 1.)

    The reporting of age 1 year older than age on April 1, 1990 is likely       
    to have been greater in areas where the census data were collected          
    later in 1990. The magnitude of this problem was much less in the           
    three previous censuses where age was typically derived from                
    respondent data on year of birth and quarter of birth. (For more            
    information on the design of the age question, see the section below        
    that discusses "Comparability.") Comparability-Age data have been           
    collected in every census. For the first time since 1950, the 1990          
    data are not available by quarter year of age. This change was made         
    so that coded information could be obtained for both age and year of        
    birth. In each census since 1940, the age of a person was assigned          
    when it was not reported. In censuses before 1940, with the exception       
    of 1880, persons of unknown age were shown as a separate category.          
    Since 1960, assignment of unknown age has been performed by a general       
    procedure described as "imputation." The specific procedures for            
    imputing age have been different in each census.                            
                                                                                
    ANCESTRY                                                                    
                                                                                
    The data on ancestry were derived from answers to questionnaire item        
    13, which was asked of a sample of persons. The question was based on       
    self-identification; the data on ancestry represent                         
    self-classification by people according to the ancestry group(s) with       
    which they most closely identify. Ancestry refers to a person's             
    ethnic origin or descent, "roots," or heritage or the place of birth        
    of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their             
    arrival in the United States. Some ethnic identities, such as               
    "Egyptian" or "Polish" can be traced to geographic areas outside the        
    United States, while other ethnicities such as "Pennsylvania Dutch"         
    or "Cajun" evolved in the United States.                                    
                                                                                
    The intent of the ancestry question was not to measure the degree of        
    attachment the respondent had to a particular ethnicity. For example,       
    a response of "Irish" might reflect total involvement in an "Irish"         
    community or only a memory of ancestors several generations removed         
    from the individual.                                                        
                                                                                
    The Census Bureau coded the responses through an automated review,          
    edit, and coding operation. The open-ended write-in ancestry item was       
    coded by subject-matter specialists into a numeric representation           
    using a code list containing over 1,000 categories. The 1990 code           
    list reflects the results of the Census Bureau's own research and           
    consultations with many ethnic experts. Marry decisions were made to        
    determine the classification of responses. These decisions affected         
    the grouping of the tabulated data. For example, the "Assyrian"             
    category includes both responses of "Assyrian" and "Chaldean."              
                                                                                
    The ancestry question allowed respondents to report one or more             
    ancestry groups. While a large number of respondents listed a single        
    ancestry, the majority of answers included more than one ethnic             
    entry. Generally, only the first two responses reported were coded in

    1990. If a response was in terms of a dual ancestry, for example,           
    Irish-English, the person was assigned two codes, in this case one          
    for Irish and another for English.                                          
                                                                                
    However, in certain cases, multiple responses such as "French               
    Canadian," "Scotch-Irish," "Greek Cypriote," and "Black Dutch" were         
    assigned a single code reflecting their status as unique groups. If a       
    person reported one of these unique groups in addition to another           
    group, for example, "Scotch-Irish English," resulting in three terms,       
    that person received one code for the unique group ("Scotch-Irish")         
    and another one for the remaining group ("English"). If a person            
    reported "English Irish French," only English and Irish were coded.         
    Certain combinations of ancestries where the ancestry group is a part       
    of another, such as "GermanBavarian," the responses were coded as a         
    single ancestry using the smaller group ('Bavarian"). Also, responses       
    such as "Polish-American" or "Italian-American" were coded and              
    tabulated as a single entry ("Polish" or "Italian").                        
                                                                                
    The Census Bureau accepted "American" as a unique ethnicity if it was       
    given alone, with an ambiguous response, or with State names. If the        
    respondent listed any other ethnic identity such as "Italian                
    American," generally the "American" portion of the response was not         
    coded. However, distinct groups such as "American Indian," "Mexican         
    American," and "African American" were coded and identified                 
    separately because they represented groups who considered themselves        
    different from those who reported as "Indian," "Mexican," or                
    "African," respectively.                                                    
                                                                                
    In all tabulations, when respondents provided an unacceptable ethnic        
    identity (for example, an uncodeable or unintelligible response such        
    as "multi-national," "adopted," or "I have no idea"), the answer was        
    included in "Ancestry not reported." The tabulations on ancestry are        
    presented Lising two types of data presentations-one used total             
    persons as the base, and the other used total responses as the base.        
    The following are categories shown in the two data presentations:           
                                                                                
        Presentation Based on Persons:                                          
                                                                                
        Single Ancestries Reported-includes all persons                         
        who reported only one ethnic group. Included in                         
        this category are persons with multiple-term responses                  
        such as "Scotch-Irish" who are assigned a single                        
        code.

        assigned two ancestry codes.                                            
        Ancestry Unclassified-Includes all persons who                          
                                                                                
        provided a response that could not be assigned an                       
        ancestry code because they provided nonsensical

        Total Ancestries Reported Includes the total num-                       
        ber of ancestries reported and coded. If a person                       
        reported a multiple ancestry such as "French                            
        Danish," that response was counted twice in the                         
        tabulations-once in the "French" category and                           
        again in the "Danish" category. Thus, the sum of                        
        the counts in this type of presentation is not the                      
        total population but the total of all responses.                        
        First Ancestry Reported-includes the first response                     
        of all persons who reported at least one codeable                       
        entry. For example, in this category, the count for                     
        "Danish" would include all those who reported                           
        only Danish and those who reported Danish first                         
        and then some other group.                                              
                                                                                
        Second Ancestry Reported-Includes the second                            
        response of all persons who reported a multiple                         
        ancestry. Thus, the count for "Danish" in this                          
        category includes all persons who reported Danish                       
        as the second response, regardless of the first                         
        response provided.                                                      
                                                                                
    The Census Bureau identified hundreds of ethnic groups in the 1990          
    census.  However, it was impossible to show information for every           
    group in all census tabulations because of space constraints.               
    Publications such as the 1990 CP-2, Social and Economic                     
    Characteristics and the 1990 CPH-3, Population and Housing                  
    Characteristics for Census Tracts and Block Numbering Areas reports         
    show a limited number of groups based on the number reported and the        
    advice received from experts. A more complete distribution of groups        
    is presented in the 1990 Summary Tape File 4, Supplementary Reports,        
    and a special subject report on ancestry. In addition, groups               
    identified specifically in the questions on race and Hispanic origin        
    (for example, Japanese, Laotian, Mexican, Cuban, and Spaniard), in          
    general, are not shown separately in ancestry tabulations.                  
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data-Although some experts consider religious             
    affiliation a component of ethnic identity, the ancestry question was       
    not designed to collect any information concerning religion. The            
    Bureau of the Census is prohibited from collecting information on           
    religion. Thus, if a religion was given as an answer to the ancestry        
    question, it was coded as an "Other" response.                              
                                                                                
    Comparability - A question on ancestry was first asked in the 1980          
    census.  Although there were no comparable data prior to the 1980           
    census, related information on ethnicity was collected through              
    questions on parental birthplace, own birthplace, and language which        
    were included in previous censuses. Unlike other census questions,          
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      ICPSR 9952                                          Page 173              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    there was no imputation for nonresponse to the ancestry question.           
                                                                                
    In 1990, respondents were allowed to report more than one ancestry          
    group; however, only the first two ancestry groups identified were          
    coded. In 1980, the Census Bureau attempted to code a third ancestry        
    for selected triple-ancestry responses.                                     
                                                                                
    New categories such as "Arab" and "West Indian" were added to the           
    1990 question to meet important data needs. The "West Indian"               
    category excluded "Hispanic" groups such as "Puerto Rican" and              
    "Cuban" that were identified primarily through the question on              
    Hispanic origin. In 1990, the ancestry group, "American" is                 
    recognized and tabulated as a unique ethnicity. In 1980, "American"         
    was tabulated but included under the category "Ancestry not                 
    specified."                                                                 
                                                                                
    A major improvement in the 1990 census was the use of an automated          
    coding system for ancestry responses. The automated coding system           
    used in the 1990 census greatly reduced the potential for error             
    associated with a clerical review. Specialists with a thorough              
    knowledge of the subject matter reviewed, edited, coded, and resolved       
    inconsistent or incomplete responses.                                       
                                                                                
    CITIZENSHIP                                                                 
                                                                                
    The data on citizenship were derived from answers to questionnaire          
    item 9, which was asked of a sample of persons.                             
                                                                                
    Citizen-Persons who indicated that they were native-born and                
    foreign-born persons who indicated that they have become naturalized.       
    (For more information on native and foreign born, see the discussion        
    under "Place of Birth.")                                                    
                                                                                
    There are four categories of citizenship: (1) born in the United            
    States, (2) born in Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands of the            
    United States, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,         
    (3) born abroad of American parents, and (4) citizen by                     
    naturalization.                                                             
                                                                                
        Naturalized Citizen-Foreign-born persons who                            
        had completed the naturalization process at the                         
        time of the census and upon whom the rights of                          
        citizenship had been conferred.                                         
                                                                                
    Not a Citizen-Foreign-born persons who were not citizens, including         
    persons who had begun but not completed the naturalization process at       
    the time of the census.                                                     
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data-Evaluation studies completed after previous          
    censuses indicated that some persons may have reported themselves as        
    citizens although they had not yet attained the status.

    Comparability-Similar questions on citizenship were asked in the            
    censuses of 1820, 1830, 1870, 1890 through 1950, 1 970, and 1980. The       
    1980 question was asked of a sample of the foreign-born population.         
    In 1990, both native and foreign-born persons who received the              
    long-form questionnaire were asked to respond to the citizenship            
    question.                                                                   
                                                                                
    EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT                                                      
                                                                                
    Data on educational attainment were derived from answers to                 
    questionnaire item 12, which was asked of a sample of persons. Data         
    are tabulated as attainment for persons 15 years old and over.              
    Persons are classified according to the highest level of school             
    completed or the highest degree received. The question included             
    instructions to report the level of the previous grade attended or          
    the highest degree received for persons currently enrolled in school.       
    The question included response categories which allowed persons to          
    report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school            
    diploma, and which instructed respondents to report as "high school         
    graduate(s)"-persons who received either a high school diploma or the       
    equivalent, for example, passed the Test of General Educational             
    Development (G.E.D.), and did not attend college. (On the Military          
    Census Report questionnaire, the lowest response category was "Less         
    than 9th grade.")                                                           
                                                                                
    Instructions included in the 1990 respondent instruction guide, which       
    was mailed with the census questionnaire, further specified that            
    schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be         
    reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American       
    system; that vocational certificates or diplomas from vocational,           
    trade, or business schools or colleges were not to be reported unless       
    they were college level degrees; and that honorary degrees were not         
    to be reported. The instructions gave "medicine, dentistry,                 
    chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry,          
    veterinary medicine, law, and theology" as examples of professional         
    school degrees, and specifically excluded "barber school,                   
    cosmetology, or other training for a specific trade" from the               
    professional school category. The order in which they were listed           
    suggested that doctorate degrees were "higher" than professional            
    school degrees, which were "higher" than master's degrees.                  
                                                                                
    Persons who did not report educational attainment were assigned the         
    attainment of a person of the same age, race or Spanish origin, and         
    sex who resided in the same or a nearby area. Persons who filled more       
    than one circle were edited to the highest level or degree reported.        
                                                                                
        High School Graduate or Higher-Includes per-                            
        sons whose highest degree was a high school                             
        diploma or its equivalent, persons who attended                         
        college or professional school, and persons who                         
        received a college, university, or professional degree.

        Persons who reported completing the 12th grade                          
        but not receiving a diploma are not included.                           
                                                                                
        Not Enrolled, Not High School Graduate-Includes                         
        persons of compulsory school attendance age or                          
        above who were not enrolled in school and were                          
        not high school graduates; these persons may be                         
        taken to be "high school dropouts." There is no                         
        restriction on when they "dropped out of school,                        
        and they may have never attended high school.                           
                                                                                
    In prior censuses, "Median school years completed" was used as a            
    summary measure of educational attainment. In 1990, the median can          
    only be calculated for groups of which less than half the members           
    have attended college. "Percent high school graduate or higher" and         
    "Percent bachelors degree or higher" are summary measures which can         
    be calculated from the present data and offer quite readily                 
    interpretable measures of differences between population subgroups.         
    To make comparisons over time, "Percent high school graduate or             
    higher". can be calculated and "Percent bachelor's degree or higher"        
    can be approximated with data from previous censuses.                       
                                                                                
    Comparability-From 1840 to 1930, the census measured educational            
    attainment by means of a basic literacy question. In 1940, a single         
    question was asked on highest grade of school completed. In the             
    censuses of 1950 through 1980, a two-part question asking highest           
    grade of school attended and whether that grade was finished was used       
    to construct highest grade or year of school completed. For persons         
    who have not attended college, the response categories in the 1990          
    educational attainment question should produce data which are               
    comparable to data on highest grade completed from earlier censuses.        
                                                                                
    The response categories for persons who have attended college were          
    modified from earlier censuses because there was some ambiguity in          
    interpreting responses in terms of the number of years of college           
    completed. For instance, it was not clear whether "completed the            
    fourth year of college," "completed the senior year of college," and        
    "college graduate" were synonomous. Research conducted shortly before       
    the census suggests that these terms were more distinct in 1990 than        
    in earlier decades, and this change may have threatened the ability         
    to estimate the number of "College graduates" from the number of            
    persons reported as having completed the fourth or a higher year of         
    college.  It was even more difficult to make inferences about               
    post-baccalaureate degrees and "Associate" degrees from highest year        
    of college completed. Thus, comparisons of post-secondary educational       
    attainment in this and earlier censuses should be made with great           
    caution.                                                                    
                                                                                
    In the 1960 and subsequent censuses, persons for whom educational           
    attainment was not reported were assigned the same attainment level         
    as a similar person whose residence was in the same or a nearby area.

    In the 1940 and 1950 censuses, persons for whom educational                 
    attainment was not reported were not allocated.                             
                                                                                
    EMPLOYMENT STATUS                                                           
                                                                                
    The data on employment status were derived from answers to                  
    questionnaire items 21, 25, and 26, which were asked of a sample of         
    persons. The series of questions on employment status was asked of          
    all persons 15 years old and over and was designed to identify, in          
    this sequence: (1) persons who worked at any time during the                
    reference week; (2) persons who did not work during the reference           
    week but who had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily        
    absent (excluding layoff); (3) persons on layoff; and (4) persons who       
    did not work during the reference week, but who were looking for work       
    during the last four weeks and were available for work during the

    "Reference Week.")                                                          
                                                                                
    The employment status data shown in this and other 1990 census              
    tabulations relate to persons 16 years old and over. Some tabulations       
    showing employment status, however, include persons 15 years old By         
    definition, these persons are classified as "Not in Labor Force.". In       
    the 1940,1950, and 1960 censuses, employment status data were               
    presented for persons 14 years old and over. The change in the              
    universe was made in 1 970 to agree with the official measurement of        
    the labor force as revised in January 1967 by the U.S. Department of        
    Labor. The 1970 census was the last to show employment data for             
    persons 14 and 15 years old.                                                
                                                                                
    Employed-All civilians 16 years old and over who were either (1) "at        
    work"-those who did any work at all during the reference week as paid       
    employees, worked in their own business or profession, worked on            
    their own farm, or worked 15 hours or more as unpaid workers on a           
    family farm or in a family business; or (2) were "with a job but not        
    at work" -those who did not work during the reference week but had          
    jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent due to           
    illness, bad weather, industrial dispute, vacation, or other personal       
    reasons.  Excluded from the employed are persons whose only activity        
    consisted of work around the house or unpaid volunteer work for             
    religious, charitable, and similar organizations; also excluded are         
    persons on active duty in the United States Armed Forces.                   
                                                                                
    Unemployed-All civilians 16 years old and over are classified as            
    unemployed if they (1) were neither "at work" nor "with a job but not       
    at work" during the reference week, and (2) were looking for work           
    during the last 4 weeks, and (3) were available to accept a job. Also       
    included as unemployed are civilians who did not work at all during         
    the reference week and were waiting to be called back to a job from         
    which they had been laid off. Examples of job seeking activities are:

    Civilian Labor Force-Consists of persons classified as employed or          
    unemployed in accordance with the criteria described above.                 
                                                                                
    Experienced Unemployed-These are unemployed persons who have worked         
    at any time in the past. Experienced Civilian Labor Force-Consists of       
    the employed and the experienced unemployed.                                
                                                                                
    Labor Force-All persons classified in the civilian labor force plus         
    members of the U.S. Armed Forces (persons on active duty with the           
    United States Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard).         
                                                                                
    Not in Labor Force-All persons 16 years old and over who are not            
    classified as members of the labor force. This category consists            
    mainly of students, housewives, retired workers, seasonal workers           
    enumerated in an off season who were not looking for work,                  
    institutionalized persons, and persons doing only incidental unpaid         
    family work (less than 15 hours during the reference week).                 
                                                                                
    Worker-This term appears in connection with several subjects:               
    journey-to-work items, class of worker, weeks worked in 1989, and           
    number of workers in family in 1989. Its meaning varies and,                
    therefore, should be determined in each case by referring to the            
    definition of the subject in which it appears.                              
                                                                                
    Actual Hours Worked Last Week-All persons who reported working during       
    the reference week were asked to report in questionnaire item 21 b          
    the number of hours that they worked. The statistics on hours worked        
    pertain to the number of hours actually worked at all jobs, and do          
    not necessarily reflect the number of hours typically or usually            
    worked or the scheduled number of hours. The concept of "actual             
    hours" differs from that of "usual hours" described below. The number       
    of persons who worked only a small number of hours is probably              
    understated since such persons sometimes consider themselves as not         
    working Respondents were asked to include overtime or extra hours           
    worked, but to exclude lunch hours, sick leave, and vacation leave.         
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data-The census may understate the number of              
    employed persons because persons who have irregular, casual, or             
    unstructured jobs sometimes report themselves as not working. The           
    number of employed persons "at work" is probably overstated in the          
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      Page 178                                          ICPSR 9952              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    census (and conversely, the number of employed "with a job, but not         
    at work" is understated) since some persons on vacation or sick leave       
    erroneously reported themselves as working. This problem has no             
    effect on the total number of employed persons. The reference week          
    for the employment data is not the same for all persons. Since              
    persons can change their employment status from one week to another,        
    the lack of a uniform reference week may mean that the employment           
    data do not reflect the reality of the employment situation of any          
    given week. (For more information, see the discussion under                 
    "Reference Week.")                                                          
                                                                                
    Comparability-The questionnaire items and employment status concepts        
    for the 1990 census are essentially the same as those used in the           
    1980 and 1970 censuses. However, these concepts differ in many              
    respects from those associated with the 1950 and 1960 censuses.             
                                                                                
    Since employment data from the census are obtained from respondents         
    in households, they differ from statistics based on reports from            
    individual business establishments, farm enterprises, and certain           
    government programs.  Persons employed at more than one job are             
    counted only once in the census and are classified according to the         
    job at which they worked the greatest number of hours during the            
    reference week. In statistics based on reports from business and farm       
    establishments, persons who work for more than one establishment may        
    be counted more than once. Moreover, some tabulations may exclude           
    private household workers, unpaid family workers, and self-employed         
    persons, but may include workers less than 16 years of age.                 
                                                                                
    An additional difference in the data arises from the fact that              
    persons who had a job but were not at work are included with the            
    employed in the census statistics, whereas many of these persons are        
    likely to be excluded from employment figures based on establishment        
    payroll reports. Furthermore, the employment status data in census          
    tabulations include persons on the basis of place of residence              
    regardless of where they work, whereas establishment data report            
    persons at their place of work regardless of where they live. This          
    latter consideration is particularly significant when comparing data        
    for workers who commute between areas.                                      
                                                                                
    Census data on actual hours worked during the reference week may            
    differ from data from other sources. The census measures hours              
    actually worked, whereas some surveys measure hours paid for by             
    employers. Comparability of census actual hours worked data may also        
    be affected by the nature of the reference week (see "Reference             
    Week").                                                                     
                                                                                
    For several reasons, the unemployment figures of the Census Bureau          
    are not comparable with published figures on unemployment                   
    compensation claims. For example, figures on unemployment                   
    compensation claims exclude persons who have exhausted their benefit        
    rights, new workers who have not earned rights to unemployment              
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      ICPSR 9952                                          Page 179              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    insurance, and persons losing jobs not covered by unemployment              
    insurance systems (including some workers in agriculture, domestic          
    services, and religious organizations, and self-employed and unpaid         
    family workers). In addition, the qualifications for drawing                
    unemployment compensation differ from the definition of unemployment        
    used by the Census Bureau. Persons working only a few hours during          
    the week and persons with a job but not at work are sometimes               
    eligible for unemployment compensation but are classified as                
    "Employed" in the census. Differences in the geographical                   
    distribution of unemployment data arise because the place where             
    claims are filed may not necessarily be the same as the place of            
    residence of the unemployed worker.                                         
                                                                                
    The figures on employment status from the decennial census are              
    generally comparable with similar data collected in the Current             
    Population Survey.  However, some difference may exist because of           
    variations in enumeration and processing techniques.                        
                                                                                
    FERTILITY                                                                   
                                                                                
    The data on fertility (also referred to as "children ever born") were       
    derived from answers to questionnaire item 20, which was asked of a         
    sample of women 15 years old and over regardless of marital status.         
    Stillbirths, stepchildren, and adopted children were excluded from          
    the number of children ever born.  Ever-married women were instructed       
    to include all children born to them before and during their most           
    recent marriage, children no longer living, and children away from          
    home, as well as children who were still living in the home. Never-         
    married women were instructed to include all children born to them.         
                                                                                
    Data are most frequently presented in terms of the aggregate number         
    of children ever born to women in the specified category and in terms       
    of the rate per 1,000 women. For purposes of calculating the                
    aggregate, the open-ended response category, "12 or more" is assigned       
    a value of 13.                                                              
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data-Although the data are assumed to be less             
    complete for out-of-wedlock births than for births occurring within         
    marriage, comparisons of 1980 census data on the fertility of single        
    women with other census sources and administrative records indicate         
    that no significant differences were found between different data           
    sources; that is, 1980 census data on children ever born to single          
    women were complete with no significant understatements of                  
    childbearing.                                                               
                                                                                
    Comparability-The wording of the question on children ever born was         
    the same in 1990 as in 1980. In 1970, however, the question on              
    children ever born was asked of all ever-married women but only of          
    never married women who received self-administered questionnaires.          
    Therefore, rates and numbers of children ever born to single women in       
    1970 may be understated.

    GROUP QUARTERS                                                              
                                                                                
    All persons not living in households are classified by the Census           
    Bureau as living in group quarters. Two general categories of persons       
    in group quarters are recognized: (1) institutionalized persons and         
    (2) other persons in group quarters (also referred to as                    
    "noninstitutional group quarters").                                         
                                                                                
    Institutionalized Persons-includes persons under formally authorized,       
    supervised care or custody in institutions at the time of                   
    enumeration. Such persons are classified as "patients or inmates" of        
    an institution regardless of the availability of nursing or medical         
    care, the length of stay, or the number of persons in the                   
    institution. Generally, institutionalized persons are restricted to         
    the institutional buildings and grounds (or must have passes or             
    escorts to leave) and thus have limited interaction with the                
    surrounding community. Also, they are generally under the care of           
    trained staff who have responsibility for their safekeeping and             
    supervision.                                                                
                                                                                
    Type of Institution-The type of institution was determined as part of       
    census enumeration activities. For institutions which specialize in         
    only one specific type of service, all patients or inmates were given       
    the same classification.  For institutions which had multiple types         
    of major services (usually general hospitals and Veterans'                  
    Administration hospitals), patients were classlied according to             
    selected types of wards. For example, in psychiatric wards of               
    hospitals, patients were classified in "mental (psychiatric)                
    hospitals"; in hospital wards for persons with chronic diseases,            
    patients were classified in "hospitals for the chronically ill." Each       
    patient or inmate was classified in only one type of institution.           
    Institutions include the following types:                                   
                                                                                
        Correctional Institutions-Includes prisons, Federal                     
        detention centers, military stockades and jails, police                 
        lockups, halfway houses, local jails, and other con-                    
        finement facilities, including work farms.                              
                                                                                
            Prisons-Where persons convicted of crimes serve                     
            their sentences. In some census products, the                       
            prisons are classified by two types of control:                     
            (1) "Federal" (operated by the Bureau of Prisons                    
            of the Department of Justice) and (2) "State."                      
            Residents who are criminally insane were classi-                    
            fied on the basis of where they resided at the time                 
            of enumeration: (1) in institutions (or hospital wards)             
            operated by departments of correction or similar                    
            agencies; or (2) in institutions operated by depart-

    Limitation of the Data-Two types of errors can occur in the                 
    classification of "types of group quarters":                                
                                                                                
        1. Misclassification of Group Quarters-During the                       
           1990 Special Place Prelist operation, the enumera-                   
           tor determined the type of group quarters associ-                    
           ated with each special place in their assignment.                    
           The enumerator used the Alphabetical Group Quar-                     
           ters Code List and Index to the Alphabetical Group                   
           Quarters Code List to assign a two-digit code                        
           number followed by either an "I," for institutional, or              
           an "N," for noninstitutional to each group quarters.                 
           In 1990, unacceptable group quarter codes were                       
           edited.                                                              
                                                                                
        2. No Classification (unknowns)-The imputation rate                     
           for type of institution was higher in 1980 (23.5                     
           percent) than in 1970 (3.3 percent). Improvements                    
           were made to the 1990 Alphabetical Group Quar-                       
           ters Code List; that is, the inclusion of more group                 
           quarters categories and an "Index to the Alphabet-                   
           ical Group Quarters Code List." (For more informa-

           see the allocation rates in 1990 CP-1, General                       
           Population Characteristics)                                          
                                                                                
    In previous censuses, allocation rates for demographic                      
    characteristics (such as age, sex, race, and marital status) of the         
    institutional population were similar to those for the total                
    population. The allocation rates for sample characteristics such as         
    school enrollment, highest grade completed, income, and veteran             
    status for the institutional and noninstitutional group quarters            
    population have been substantially higher than the population in            
    households at least as far back as the 1960 census. The data,               
    however, have historically presented a reasonable picture of the            
    institutional and noninstitutional group quarters population.               
                                                                                
    Shelter and Street, Night (S-Night)-For the 1990 census                     
    "Shelter-and-Street-Night" operation, persons well hidden, moving           
    about, or in locations enumerators did not visit were likely to be          
    missed. The number of people missed will never be known; thus, the          
    1990 census cannot be considered to include a definitive count of           
    America's total homeless population. It does, however, give an idea         
    of relative differences among areas of the country. Other components        
    were counted as part of regular census procedures.                          
                                                                                
    The count of persons in shelters and visible on the street could have       
    been affected by many factors. How much the factors affected the            
    count can never be answered definitively, but some elements include:

     1. How well enumerators were trained and how well                          
        they followed procedures.                                               
                                                                                
     2. How well the list of shelter and street locations                       
        given to the Census Bureau by the local govern-                         
        ment reflected the actual places that homeless                          
        persons stay at night.                                                  
                                                                                
     3. Cities were encouraged to open temporary shelters                       
        for census night, and many did that and actively                        
        encouraged people to enter the shelters. Thus,                          
        people who may have been on the street otherwise                        
        were in shelters the night of March 20, so that the                     
        ratio of shelter-to-street population could be differ-                  
        ent than usual.                                                         
                                                                                
     4. The weather, which was unusually cold in some                           
        parts of the country, could affect how likely people                    
        were to seek emergency shelter or to be more                            
        hidden than usual if they stayed outdoors.                              
                                                                                
     5. The media occasionally interfered with the ability to                   
        do the count.                                                           
                                                                                
     6. How homeless people perceived the census and                            
        whether they wanted to be counted or feared the                         
        census and hid from it.                                                 
                                                                                
    The Census Bureau conducted two assessments of Shelter and Street           
    Night: (1) the quality of the lists of shelter's used for the               
    Shelter-and-Street-Night operation, and (2) how well procedures were        
    followed by censustakers for the street count in parts of five cities       
    (Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York, and Phoenix).                 
    Information about these two assessments is available from the Chief,        
    Center for Survey Methods Research, Bureau of the Census, Washington,       
    DC 20233.                                                                   
                                                                                
    Comparability-For the 1990 census, the definition of                        
    institutionalized persons was revised so that the definition of             
    "care" only includes persons under organized medical or                     
    formally-authorized, supervised care or custody. As a result of this        
    change to the institutional definition, maternity homes are                 
    classified as noninstitutional rather than institutional group              
    quarters as in previous censuses. The following types of other group        
    quarters are classified as institutional rather than noninstitutional       
    group quarters: "halfway houses (operated for correctional purposes)"       
    and "wards in general and military hospitals for patients who have no       
    usual home elsewhere," which includes maternity, neonatal, pediatric,       
    military, and surgical wards of hospitals, other purpose wards of           
    hospitals, and wards for infectious diseases. These changes should          
    not significantly affect the comparability of data with earlier

    censuses because of the relatively small number of persons involved.        
                                                                                
    As in 1980, 10 or more unrelated persons living together were               
    classified as living in noninstitutional group quarters. In 1970, the       
    criteria was six or more unrelated persons.                                 
                                                                                
    Several changes also have occurred in the identification of specific        
    types of group quarters. For the first time, the 1990 census                
    identifies separately the following types of correctional                   
    institutions: persons in halfway houses (operated for correctional          
    purposes), military stockades and jails, and police lockups. In 1990,       
    tuberculosis hospitals or wards are included with hospitals for the         
    chronically ill; in 1980, they were shown separately. For 1990, the         
    noninstitutional group quarters category, "Group homes" is further          
    classified as: group homes for drug/ alcohol abuse; maternity homes         
    (for unwed mothers), group homes for the mentally ill, group homes          
    for the mentally retarded, and group homes for the physically               
    handicapped. Persons living in communes, fostercare homes, and job          
    corps centers are classified with "Other group homes" only if 10 or         
    more unrelated persons share the unit; otherwise, they are classified       
    as housing units.                                                           
                                                                                
    In 1990, workers' dormitories were classified as group quarters             
    regardless of the number of persons sharing the dorm. In 1980, 10 or        
    more unrelated persons had to share the dorm for it to be classified        
    as a group quarters. In 1960, data on persons in military barracks          
    were shown only for men. In subsequent censuses, they include both          
    men and women.                                                              
                                                                                
    In 1990 census data products, the phrase "inmates of institutions"          
    was changed to "institutionalized persons." Also, persons living in         
    noninstitutional group quarters were referred to as "other persons in       
    group quarters," and the phrase "staff residents" was used for staff        
    living in institutions.                                                     
                                                                                
    In 1990, there are additional institutional categories and                  
    noninstitutional group quarters categories compared with the 1980           
    census. The institutional categories added include "hospitals and           
    wards for drug/alcohol abuse" and "military hospitals for the               
    chronically ill." The noninstitutional group quarters categories            
    added include emergency shelters for homeless persons; shelters for         
    runaway, neglected, and homeless children; shelters for abused women;       
    and visible-in-street locations. Each of these noninstitutional group       
    quarters categories was enumerated on March 20-21, 1990, during the         
    "Shelter-and-Street-Night" operation, (For more information on the          
    "Shelter-and-Street-Night" operation, see Appendix D, Collection and        
    Processing Procedures.)                                                     
                                                                                
    HISPANIC ORIGIN                                                             
                                                                                
    The data on Spanish/ Hispanic origin were derived from answers to

    questionnaire item 7, which was asked of all persons. Persons of            
    Hispanic origin are those who classified themselves in one of the           
    specific Hispanic origin categories listed on the                           
    questionnaire-"Mexican," "Puerto Rican," or "Cuban"-as well as those        
    who indicated that they were of "other Spanish/Hispanic" origin.            
    Persons of "Other Spanish/Hispanic" origin are those whose origins          
    are from Spain, the Spanish-speaking countries of Central or South          
    America, or the Dominican Republic, or they are persons of Hispanic         
    origin identifying themselves generally as Spanish, Spanish-American,       
    Hispanic, Hispano, Latino, and so on. Write-in responses to the             
    "other Spanish/Hispanic" category were coded only for sample data.          
                                                                                
    Origin can be viewed as the ancestry, nationality group, lineage, or        
    country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors         
    before their arrival in the United States. Persons of Hispanic origin       
    may be of any race.                                                         
                                                                                
    Some tabulations are shown by the Hispanic origin of the householder.       
    In all cases where households, families, or occupied housing units          
    are classified by Hispanic origin, the Hispanic origin of the               
    householder is used. (See the discussion of householder under               
    "Household Type and Relationship.")                                         
                                                                                
    During direct interviews conducted by enumerators, if a person could        
    not provide a single origin response, he or she was asked to select,        
    based on self-identification, the group which best described his or         
    her origin or descent. If a person could not provide a single group,        
    the origin of the person's mother was used. If a single group could         
    not be provided for the person's mother, the first origin reported by       
    the person was used.                                                        
                                                                                
    If any household member failed to respond to the Spanish/Hispanic           
    origin question, a response was assigned by the computer according to       
    the reported entries of other household members by using specific           
    rules of precedence of household relationship. In the processing of         
    sample questionnaires, responses to other questions on the                  
    questionnaire, such as ancestry and place of birth, were used to            
    assign an origin before any reference was made to the origin reported       
    by other household members. If an origin was not entered for any            
    household member, an origin was assigned from another household             
    according to the race of the householder.                                   
                                                                                
    Comparability-There may be differences between the total Hispanic           
    origin population based on 100-percent tabulations and sample               
    tabulations. Such differences are the result of sampling variability,       
    nonsampling error, and more extensive edit procedures for the               
    Spanish/ Hispanic origin item on the sample questionnaires.                 
                                                                                
    The 1990 data on Hispanic origin are generally comparable with those        
    for the 1980 census. However, there are some differences in the             
    format of the Hispanic origin question between the two censuses. For

    1990, the word "descent" was deleted from the 1980 wording. In              
    addition, the term "Mexican-Amer." used in 1980 was shortened further       
    to "Mexican-Am." to reduce misreporting (of "American") in this             
    category detected in the 1980 census. Finally, the 1990 question            
    allowed those who reported as "other Spanish/ Hispanic" to write in         
    their specific Hispanic origin group.                                       
                                                                                
    Misreporting in the "Mexican-Amer." category of the 1980 census item        
    on Spanish/Hispanic origin may affect the comparability of 1980 and         
    1990 census data for persons of Hispanic origin for certain areas of        
    the country. An evaluation of the 1980 census item on Spanish/              
    Hispanic origin indicated that there was misreporting in the Mexican        
    origin category by White and Black persons in certain areas. The            
    study results showed evidence that the misreporting occurred in the         
    South (excluding Texas), the Northeast (excluding the New York City         
    area), and a few States in the Midwest Region. Also, results based on       
    available data suggest that the impact of possible misreporting of          
    Mexican origin in the 1980 census was severe in those portions of the       
    above-mentioned regions where the Hispanic origin population was            
    generally sparse. However, national 1980 census data on the Mexican         
    origin population or total Hispanic origin population at the national       
    level was not seriously affected by the reporting problem. (For a

    Reports.)                                                                   
                                                                                
    The 1990 and 1980 census data on the Hispanic population are not            
    directly comparable with 1970 Spanish origin data because of a number       
    of factors: (1) overall improvements in the 1980 and 1990 censuses,         
    (2) better coverage of the population, (3) improved question designs,       
    and (4) an effective public relations campaign by the Census Bureau         
    with the assistance of national and community ethnic groups.                
                                                                                
    Specific changes in question design between the 1980 and 1970               
    censuses included the placement of the category "No, not Spanish/           
    Hispanic" as the first category in that question. (The                      
    corresponding category appeared last in the 1970 question.) Also, the       
    1970 category "Central or South American" was deleted because in 1970       
    some respondents misinterpreted the category; furthermore, the              
    designations "Mexican-American" and "Chicano" were added to the             
    Spanish/Hispanic origin question in 1980. In the 1970 census, the           
    question on Spanish origin was asked of only a 5-percent sample of          
    the population.

    A household includes all the persons who occupy a housing unit. A           
    housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of            
    rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended

    for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters        
    are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any           
    other persons in the building and which have direct access from the         
    outside of the building or through a common hall. The occupants may         
    be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families           
    living together, or any other group of related or unrelated persons         
    who share living arrangements.                                              
                                                                                
    In 100-percent tabulations, the count of households or householders         
    always equals the count of occupied housing units. In sample                
    tabulations, the numbers may differ as a result of the weighting            
    process.                                                                    
                                                                                
    Persons Per Household-A measure obtained by dividing the number of          
    persons in households by the number of households (or householders).        
    In cases where persons in households are cross-classified by race           
    or Hispanic origin, persons in the household are classified by the          
    race or Hispanic origin of the householder rather than the race or          
    Hispanic origin of each individual.                                         
                                                                                
    Relationship to Householder                                                 
                                                                                
    Householder-The data on relationship to householder were derived from       
    answers to questionnaire item 2, which was asked of all persons in          
    housing units. One person in each household is designated as the            
    householder. In most cases, this is the person, or one of the               
    persons, in whose name the home is owned, being bought, or rented and       
    who is listed in column 1 of the census questionnaire. If there is no       
    such person in the household, any adult household member 15 years old       
    and over could be designated as the householder.                            
                                                                                
    Households are classified by type according to the sex of the               
    householder and the presence of relatives. Two types of householders        
    are distinguished: a family householder and a nonfamily householder.        
    A family householder is a householder living with one or more persons       
    related to him or her by birth, marriage, or adoption. The                  
    householder and all persons in the household related to him or her          
    are family members. A nonfamily householder is a householder living         
    alone or with nonrelatives only.                                            
                                                                                
    Spouse-Includes a person married to and living with a householder.          
    This category includes persons in formal marriages, as well as              
    persons in common-law marriages.                                            
                                                                                
    The number of spouses is equal to the number of "married-couple             
    families" or "married-couple households" in 100-percent tabulations.        
    The number of spouses, however, is generally less than half of the          
    number of married persons with spouse present" in sample tabulations,       
    since more than one married couple can live in a household, but only        
    spouses of householders are specifically identified as "spouse." For        
    sample tabulations, the number of "married persons with spouse

    Child-Includes a son or daughter by birth, a stepchild, or adopted          
    child of the householder, regardless of the child's age or marital          
    status. The category excludes sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, and            
    foster children.                                                            
                                                                                
        Natural-Born or Adopted Son/Daughter-A son or                           
        daughter of the householder by birth, regardless of                     
        the age of the child. Also, this category includes sons                 
        or daughters of the householder by legal adoption,                      
        regardless of the age of the child. If the stepson/ step-               
        daughter of the householder has been legally adopted                    
        by the householder, the child is still classified as a                  
        stepchild.

        ter of the householder has been legally adopted by                      
        the householder, the child is still classified as a                     
        stepchild.

        who is a son or daughter by birth, a stepchild, or an                   
        adopted child of the householder. In certain tabula-                    
        tions, own children are further classified as living with               
        two parents or with one parent only. Own children of

        In a subfamily, an "own child" is a never-married                       
        child under 18 years of age who is a son, daughter,

    A family consists of a householder and one or more other persons            
    living in the same household who are related to the householder by          
    birth, marriage, or adoption. All persons in a household who are            
    related to the householder are regarded as members of his or her            
    family. A household can contain only one family for purposes of             
    census tabulations. Not all households contain families since a             
    household may comprise a group of unrelated persons or one person           
    living alone.                                                               
                                                                                
    Families are classified by type as either a "married-couple family"         
    or "other family" according to the sex of the householder and the           
    presence of relatives.  The data on family type are based on answers        
    to questions on sex and relationship which were asked on a 100percent       
    basis.                                                                      
                                                                                
        Married-Couple Family-A family in which the house-                      
        holder and his or her spouse are enumerated as                          
        members of the same household.

        Male Householder, No Wife Present-A family with a                       
        male householder and no spouse of householder                           
        present.

        householder present.                                                    
                                                                                
    Persons Per Family-A measure obtained by dividing the number of             
    persons in families by the total number of families (or family              
    householders). In cases where the measure, "persons in family" or           
    "persons per family" are cross-tabulated by race or Hispanic origin,        
    the race or Hispanic origin refers to the householder rather than the       
    race or Hispanic origin of each individual.                                 
                                                                                
    Subfamily                                                                   
                                                                                
    A subfamily is a married couple (husband and wife enumerated as             
    members of the same household) with or without never-married children       
    under 18 years old, or one parent with one or more never-married            
    children under 18 years old, living in a household and related to,          
    but not including, either the householder or the householder's              
    spouse. The number of subfamilies is not included in the count of           
    families, since subfamily members are counted as part of the                
    householder's family.                                                       
                                                                                
    Subfamilies are defined during processing of sample data. In selected       
    tabulations, subfamilies are further classified by type:

    married-couple subfamilies, with or without own children;

    Lone parents include people maintaining either one-parent families or       
    one-parent subfamilies. Married couples include husbands and wives in       
    both married-couple families and married-couple subfamilies.                
                                                                                
    Unmarried-Partner Household                                                 
                                                                                
    An unmarried-partner household is a household other than a                  
    "married-couple household" that includes a householder and an               
    "unmarried partner." An "unmarried partner" can be of the same sex          
    or-of the opposite sex of the householder.  An "unmarried partner" in       
    an unmarried-partner household" is an adult who is unrelated to the         
    householder, but shares living quarters and has a close personal            
    relationship with the householder.

    An unmarried-couple household is composed of two unrelated adults of        
    the opposite sex (one of whom is the householder) who share a housing       
    unit with or without the presence of children under 15 years old.

    Foster children are nonrelatives of the householder and are included        
    in the category, "Roomer, boarder, or foster child" on the                  
    questionnaire. Foster children are identified as persons under 18           
    years old and living in households that have no nonrelatives 18 years       
    old and over (who might be parents of the nonrelatives under 18 years       
    old.

    A stepfamily is a "married-couple family" with at least one stepchild       
    of the householder present, where the householder is the husband.           
                                                                                
    Comparability-The 1990 definition of a household is the same as that        
    used in 1980. The 1980 relationship category "Son/daughter" has been        
    replaced by two categories, "Natural-born or adopted son/daughter"          
    and "Stepson/stepdaughter."  "Grandchild" has been added as a               
    separate category. The 1980 nonrelative categories: "Roomer, boarder'       
    and "Partner, roommate" have been replaced by the categories "Roomer,       
    boarder, or foster child ... .. Housemate, roommate," and "Unmarried        
    partner." The 1980 nonrelative category "Paid employee" has been            
    dropped.

    Income of Households-Includes the income of the householder and all         
    other persons 15 years old and over in the household, whether related       
    to the house-holder or not. Because many households consist of only         
    one person, average household income is usually less than average           
    family income.                                                              
                                                                                
    Income of Families and Persons-In compiling statistics on family            
    income, the incomes of all members 15 years old and over in each            
    family are summed and treated as a single amount. However, for              
    persons 15 years old and over, the total amounts of their own incomes       
    are used. Although the income statistics covered the calendar year          
    1989, the characteristics of persons and the composition of families        
    refer to the time of enumeration (April 1990). Thus, the income of          
    the family does not include amounts received by persons who were            
    members of the family during all or part of the calendar year 1989 if       
    these persons no longer resided with the family at the time of              
    enumeration. Yet, family income amounts reported by related persons         
    who did not reside with the family during 1989 but who were members         
    of the family at the time of enumeration are included. However, the         
    composition of most families was the same during 1989 as in April           
    1990.                                                                       
                                                                                
    Median Income-The median divides the income distribution into two           
    equal parts, one having incomes above the median and the other having       
    incomes below the median. For households and families, the median           
    income is based on the distribution of the total number of units            
    including those with no income. The median for persons is based on          
    persons with income. The median income values for all households,           
    families, and persons are computed on the basis of more detailed            
    income intervals than shown in most tabulations. Median household or        
    family income figures of $50,000 or less are calculated using linear        
    interpolation. For persons, corresponding median values of $40,000 or       
    less are also computed using linear interpolation. All other median         
    income amounts are derived through Pareto interpolation. (For more          
    information on medians and interpolation, see the discussion under          
    "Derived Measures.")                                                        
                                                                                
    Mean Income-This is the amount obtained by dividing the total income        
    of a particular statistical universe by the number of units in that         
    universe. Thus, mean household income is obtained by dividing total         
    household income by the total number of households. For the various         
    types of income the means are based on households having those types        
    of income. "Per capita income" is the mean income computed for every        
    man, woman, and child in a particular group. It is derived by               
    dividing the total income of a particular group by the total                
    population in that group.                                                   
                                                                                
    Care should be exercised in using and interpreting mean income values       
    for small subgroups of the population. Because the mean is influenced       
    strongly by extreme values in the distribution, it is especially

    susceptible to the effects of sampling variability, misreporting, and       
    processing errors. The median, which is not affected by extreme             
    values, is, therefore, a better measure than the mean when the              
    population base is small. The mean, nevertheless, is shown in some          
    data products for most small subgroups because, when weighted               
    according to the number of cases, the means can be added to obtained        
    summary measures for areas and groups other than those shown in             
    census tabulations.                                                         
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data-Since questionnaire entries for income               
    frequently are based on memory and not on records, many persons             
    tended to forget minor or irregular sources of income and, therefore,       
    underreport their income.  Underreporting tends to be more pronounced       
    for income sources that are not derived from earnings, such as Social       
    Security, public assistance, or from interest, dividends, and net           
    rental income.                                                              
                                                                                
    There are errors of reporting due to the misunderstanding of the            
    income questions such as reporting gross rather than net dollar             
    amounts for the two questions on net self-employment income, which          
    resulted in an overstatement of these items. Another common error is        
    the reporting of identical dollar amounts in two of the eight type of       
    income items where a respondent with only one source of income              
    assumed that the second amount should be entered to represent total         
    income. Such instances of overreporting had an impact on the level of       
    mean nonfarm or farm self-employment income and mean total income           
    published for the various geographical subdivisions of the State.           
                                                                                
    Extensive computer editing procedures were instituted in the data           
    processing operation to reduce some of these reporting errors and to        
    improve the accuracy of the income data. These procedures corrected         
    various reporting deficiencies and improved the consistency of              
    reported income items associated with work experience and information       
    on occupation and class of worker. For example, if persons reported         
    they were self-employed on their own farm, not incorporated, but had        
    reported wage and salary earnings only, the latter amount was shifted       
    to net farm self-employment income. Also, if any respondent reported        
    total income only, the amount was generally assigned to one of the          
    type of income items according to responses to the work experience          
    and class-of-worker questions. Another type of problem involved             
    nonreporting of income data. Where income information was not               
    reported, procedures were devised to imputed appropriate values with        
    either no income or positive or negative dollar amounts for the             
    missing entries.                                                            
                                                                                
    In income tabulations for households and families, the lowest income        
    group (e.g., less than $5,000) includes units that were classified as       
    having no 1989 income. Many of these were living on income "in kind,"       
    savings, or gifts, were newly created families, or families in which        
    the sole bread winner had recently died or left the household.              
    However, many of the households and families who reported no income         
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      ICPSR 9952                                          Page 203              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    probably had some money income which was not recorded in the census.        
                                                                                
    The income data presented in the tabulations covers money income            
    only. The fact that many farm families receive an important part of         
    their income in the form of "free" housing and goods produced and           
    consumed on the farm rather than in money should be taken into              
    consideration in comparing the income of farm and nonfarm residents.        
    Nonmoney income such as business expense accounts, use of business          
    transportation and facilities, or partial compensation by business          
    for medical and educational expenses was also received by some              
    nonfarm residents.  Many low income families also receive income "in        
    kind" from public welfare programs. In comparing income data for 1989       
    with earlier years, it should be noted that an increase or decrease         
    in money income does not necessarily represent a comparable change in       
    real income, unless adjustments for changes in prices are made.             
                                                                                
    Comparability-The income data collected in the 1980 and 1970 censuses       
    are similar to the 1990 census data, but there are variations in the        
    detail of the questions. In 1980, income information for 1979 was           
    collected from persons in approximately 19 percent of all housing           
    units and group quarters. Each person was required to report:               
                                                                                
      * Wage or salary income                                                   
                                                                                
      * Net nonfarm self-employment income                                      
                                                                                
      * Net farm self-employment income                                         
                                                                                
      * Interest, dividend, or net rental or royalty income                     
                                                                                
      * Social Security income                                                  
                                                                                
      * Public assistance income                                                
                                                                                
      * Income from all other sources                                           
                                                                                
    Between the 1980 and 1990 censuses, there were minor differences in         
    the processing of the data. In both censuses, all persons with              
    missing values in one or more of the detailed type of income items          
    and total income were designated as allocated. Each missing entry was       
    imputed either as a "no" or as a dollar amount. If total income was         
    reported and one or more of the type of income fields was not               
    answered, then the entry in total income generally was assigned to          
    one of the income types according to the socioeconomic char-                
    acteristics of the income recipient. This person was designated as          
    unallocated.                                                                
                                                                                
    In 1980 and 1990, all nonrespondents with income not reported               
    (whether heads of households or other persons) were assigned the            
    reported income of persons with similar characteristics.

    There was a difference in the method of computer derivation of              
    aggregate income from individual amounts between the two census             
    processing operations. In the 1980 census, income amounts less than         
    $100,000 were coded in tens of dollars, and amounts of $100,000 or          
    more were coded in thousands of dollars; $5 was added to each amount        
    coded in tens of dollars and $500 to each amount coded in thousands         
    of dollars. Entries of $999,000 or more were treated as $999,500 and        
    losses of $9,999 or more were treated as minus $9,999. In the 1990          
    census, income amounts less than $999,999 were keyed in dollars.            
    Amounts of $999,999 or more were treated as $999,999 and losses of          
    $9,999 or more were treated as minus $9,999 in all of the computer          
    derivations of aggregate income.                                            
                                                                                
    In 1970, information on income in 1969 was obtained from all members        
    in every fifth housing unit and small group quarters (less than 15          
    persons) and every fifth person in all other group quarters. Each           
    person was required to report:                                              
                                                                                
      * Wage or salary income                                                   
                                                                                
      * Net nonfarm self-employment income                                      
                                                                                
      * Net farm self-employment income                                         
                                                                                
      * Social Security or Railroad Retirement                                  
                                                                                
      * Public assistance or welfare payments                                   
                                                                                
      * Income from all other sources                                           
                                                                                
    If a person reported a dollar amount in wage or salary, net nonfarm         
    self-employment income, or net farm self-employment income, the             
    person was considered as unallocated only if no further dollar              
    amounts were imputed for any additional missing entries.                    
                                                                                
    In 1960, data on income were obtained from all members in every             
    fourth housing unit and from every fourth person 14 years old and           
    over living in group quarters. Each person was required to report           
    wage or salary income, net self-employment income, and income other         
    than earnings received in 1959. An assumption was made in the editing       
    process that no other type of income was received by a person who           
    reported the receipt of either wage and salary income or                    
    self-employment but who had failed to report the receipt of other           
    money income.                                                               
                                                                                
    For several reasons, the income data shown in census tabulations are        
    not directly comparable with those that may be obtained from                
    statistical summaries of income tax returns. Income, as defined for         
    Federal tax purposes, differs somewhat from the Census Bureau               
    concept. Moreover, the coverage of income tax statistics is different       
    because of the exemptions of persons having small amounts of income

    and the inclusion of net capital gains in tax returns.  Furthermore,        
    members of some families file separate returns and others file joint        
    returns; consequently, the income reporting unit is not consistently        
    either a family or a person.                                                
                                                                                
    The earnings data shown in census tabulations are not directly              
    comparable with earnings records of the Social Security                     
    Administration. The earnings record data for 1989 excluded the              
    earnings of most civilian government employees, some employees of           
    nonprofit organizations, workers covered by the Railroad Retirement         
    Act, and persons not covered by the program because of insufficient         
    earnings. Furthermore, earnings received from any one employer in           
    excess of $48,000 in 1989 are not covered by earnings records.              
    Finally, because census data are obtained from household                    
    questionnaires, they may differ from Social Security Administration         
    earnings record data, which are based upon employers' reports and the       
    Federal income tax returns of self-employed persons.                        
                                                                                
    The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the Department of Commerce         
    publishes annual data on aggregate and per-capita personal income           
    received by the population for States, metropolitan areas, and              
    selected counties. Aggregate income estimates based on the income           
    statistics shown in census products usually would be less than those        
    shown in the BEA income series for several reasons. The Census Bureau       
    data are obtained directly from households, whereas the BEA income          
    series is estimated largely on the basis of data from administrative        
    records of business and governmental sources. Moreover, the                 
    definitions of income are different. The BEA income series includes         
    some items not included in the income data shown in census                  
    publications, such as income "in kind," income received by nonprofit        
    institutions, the value of services of banks and other financial            
    intermediaries rendered to persons without the assessment of specific       
    charges, Medicare payments, and the income of persons who died or           
    emigrated prior to April 1, 1990. On the other hand the census income       
    data include contributions for support received from persons not            
    residing in the same household and employer contributions for social        
    insurance.                                                                  
                                                                                
    INDUSTRY, OCCUPATION, AND CLASS OF WORKER                                   
                                                                                
    The data on industry, occupation, and class of worker were derived          
    from answers to questionnaire items 28, 29, and 30 respectively.            
    These questions were asked of a sample of persons. Information on           
    industry relates to the kind of business conducted by a person's            
    employing organization; occupation describes the kind of work the           
    person does on the job.                                                     
                                                                                
    For employed persons, the data refer to the person's job during the         
    reference week. For those who worked at two or more jobs, the data          
    refer to the job at which the person worked the greatest number of          
    hours. For unemployed persons, the data refer to their last job. The

    industry and occupation statistics are derived from the detailed            
    classification systems developed for the 1990 census as described           
    below. The Classified Index of Industries and Occupations provided          
    additional information on the industry and occupation classification        
    systems.                                                                    
                                                                                
    Respondents provided the data for the tabulations by writing on the         
    questionnaires descriptions of their industry and occupation. These         
    descriptions were keyed and passed through automated coding software        
    which assigned a portion of the written entries to categories in the        
    classification system. The automated system assigned codes to 59            
    percent of the industry enthes and 38 percent of the occupation             
    entries.                                                                    
                                                                                
    Those cases not coded by the computer were referred to clerical staff       
    in the Census Bureau's Kansas City processing off ice for coding. The       
    clerical staff converted the written questionnaire descriptions to          
    codes by comparing these descriptions to entries in the Alphabetical        
    Index of Industries and Occupations. For the industry code, these           
    coders also referred to an Employer Name List (formerly called              
    Company Name List). This list, prepared from the Standard Statistical       
    Establishment List developed by the Census Bureau for the economic          
    censuses and surveys, contained the names of business establishments        
    and their Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes converted to       
    population census equivalents. This list facilitated coding and             
    maintained industrial classification comparability.                         
                                                                                
    Industry                                                                    
                                                                                
    The industry classification system developed for the 1990 census            
    consists of 235 categories for employed persons, classified into 13         
    major industry groups.  Since 1940, the industrial classification has       
    been based on the Standard Industrial Classification Manual (SIC).          
    The 1990 census classification was developed from the 1987 SIC              
    published by the Office of Management and Budget Executive Office of        
    the President.                                                              
                                                                                
    The SIC was designed primarily to classify establishments by the type       
    of industrial activity in which they were engaged. However, census          
    data, which were collected from households, differ in detail and            
    nature from those obtained from establishment surveys. Therefore, the       
    census classification systems, while defined in SIC terms, cannot           
    reflect the full detail in all categories.  There are several levels        
    of industrial classification found in census products.  For example,        
    the 1990 CP-2, Social and Economic Characteristics report includes 41       
    unique industrial categories, while the 1990 Summary Tape File 4 (STF       
    4) presents 72 categories.                                                  
                                                                                
    Occupation

    consists of 500 specific occupational categories for employed persons       
    arranged into 6 summary and 13 major occupational groups. This              
    classification was developed to be consistent with the Standard             
    Occupational Classification (SOC) Manual: 1980, published by the Off-       
    ice of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards, U.S. Department of         
    Commerce. Tabulations with occupation as the primary characteristic         
    present several levels of occupational detail. The most detailed            
    tabulations are shown in a special 1990 subject report and tape files       
    on occupation. These products contain all 500 occupational categories       
    plus industry or class of worker subgroupings of occupational               
    categories.                                                                 
                                                                                
    Some occupation groups are related closely to certain industries.           
    Operators of transportation equipment, farm operators and workers,          
    and private household workers account for major portions of their           
    respective industries of transportation, agriculture, and private           
    households. However, the industry categories include persons in other       
    occupations. For example, persons employed in agriculture include           
    truck drivers and bookkeepers; persons employed in the transportation       
    industry include mechanics, freight handlers, and payroll clerks; and       
    persons employed in the private household industry include                  
    occupations such as chauffeur, gardener, and secretary.                     
                                                                                
    Class of Worker                                                             
                                                                                
    The data on class of worker were derived from answers to                    
    questionnaire item 30.  The information on class of worker refers to        
    the same job as a respondent's industry and occupation and                  
    categorizes persons according to the type of ownership of the               
    employing organization. The class of worker categories are defined as       
    follows:                                                                    
                                                                                
    Private Wage and Salary Workers-Includes persons who worked for             
    wages, salary, commission, tips, pay-in-kind, or piece rates for a          
    private for profit employer or a private not-for-profit, tax-exempt         
    or charitable organization.  Self-employed persons whose business was       
    incorporated are included with private wage and salary workers              
    because they are paid employees of their own companies. Some                
    tabulations present data separately for these subcategories: "For           
    profit," "Not for profit," and "Own business incorporated." Employees       
    of foreign governments, the United Nations, or other formal                 
    international organizations were classified as                              
    "Private-not-for-profit."                                                   
                                                                                
    Government Workers-Includes persons who were employees of any local,        
    State, or Federal governmental unit, regardless of the activity of          
    the particular agency.  For some tabulations, the data were presented       
    separately for the three levels of government.                              
                                                                                
    Self-Employed Workers-Includes persons who worked for profit or fees        
    in their own unincorporated business, profession, or trade, or who

    operated a farm.                                                            
                                                                                
    Unpaid Family Workers-Includes persons who worked 15 hours or more          
    without pay in a business or on a farm operated by a relative.              
                                                                                
    Salaried/Self-Employed-in tabulations that categorize persons as            
    either salaried or self-employed, the salaried category includes            
    private and government wage and salary workers; self-employed               
    includes self-employed persons and unpaid family workers.                   
                                                                                
    The industry category, "Public administration," is limited to regular       
    government functions such as legislative, judicial, administrative,         
    and regulatory activities of governments. Other government                  
    organizations such as schools, hospitals, liquor stores, and bus            
    lines are classified by industry according to the activity in which         
    they are engaged. On the other hand, the class of worker government         
    categories include all government workers.                                  
                                                                                
    Occasionally respondents supplied industry, occupation, or class of         
    worker descriptions which were not sufficiently specific for precise        
    classification or did not report on these items at all. Some of these       
    cases were corrected through the field editing process and during the       
    coding and tabulation operations. In the coding operation, certain          
    types of incomplete entries were corrected using the Alphabetical           
    Index of Industries and Occupations. For example, it was possible in        
    certain situations to assign an industry code based on the occupation       
    reported.                                                                   
                                                                                
    Following the coding operations, there was a computer edit and an           
    allocation process. The edit first determined whether a respondent          
    was in the universe which required an industry and occupation code.         
    The codes for the three items (industry, occupation, and class of           
    worker) were checked to ensure they were valid and were edited for          
    their relation to each other. Invalid and inconsistent codes were           
    either blanked or changed to a consistent code.                             
                                                                                
    If one or more of the three codes were blank after the edit, a code         
    was assigned from a "similar" person based on other items such as           
    age, sex, education, farm or nonfarm residence, and weeks worked. If        
    all the labor force and income data also were blank, all these              
    economic items were assigned from one other person who provided all         
    the necessary data.                                                         
                                                                                
    Comparability-Comparability of industry and occupation data was             
    affected by a number of factors, primarily the systems used to              
    classify the questionnaire responses. For both the industry and             
    occupation classification systems, the basic structures were                
    generally the same from 1940 to 1970, but changes in the individual         
    categories limited comparability of the data from one census to             
    another. These changes were needed to recognize the "birth" of new          
    industries and occupations, the "death" of others, and the growth and

    decline in existing industries and occupations, as well as, the             
    desire of analysts and other users for more detail in the                   
    presentation of the data. Probably the greatest cause of                    
    incomparability is the movement of a segment of a category to a             
    different category in the next census. Changes in the nature of jobs        
    and respondent terminology, and refinement of category composition          
    made these movements necessary.                                             
                                                                                
    In the 1990 census, the industry classification had minor revisions         
    to reflect recent changes to the SIC. The 1990 occupational                 
    classification system is essentially the same as that for the 1980          
    census. However, the conversion of the census classification to the         
    SOC in 1980 meant that the 1990 classification system was less              
    comparable to the classifications used prior to the 1980 census.            
                                                                                
    Other factors that affected data comparability included the universe        
    to which the data referred (in 1970, the age cutoff for labor force         
    was changed from 14 years to 16 years); how the industry and                
    occupation questions were worded on the questionnaire (for example,         
    important changes were made in 1970); improvements in the coding            
    procedures (the Employer Name List technique was introduced in 1960);       
    and how the "not reported' cases are handled. Prior to 1970, they           
    were placed in the residual categories, "Industry not reported" and         
    "Occupation not reported." In 1970, an allocation process was               
    introduced that assigned these cases to major groups. In 1990, as in        
    1980, the "Not reported" cases were assigned to individual                  
    categories. Therefore, the 1980 and 1990 data for individual                
    categories included some numbers of persons who were tabulated in a         
    "Not reported" category in previous censuses.                               
                                                                                
    The following publications contain information on the various factors

    The 1990 census introduced an additional class of worker category for       
    "private not-for-profit" employers. This category is a subset of the        
    1980 category "employee of private employer" so there is no                 
    comparable data before 1990. Also in 1990, employees of foreign             
    governments, the United Nations, etc., are classified as "private           
    not-for-profit," rather than Federal Government as in 1970 and 1980.        
    While in theory, there was a change in comparability, in practice,

    the small number of U.S. residents working for foreign governments          
    made this change negligible.                                                
                                                                                
    Comparability between the statistics on industry and occupation from        
    the 1990 census and statistics from other sources is affected by many       
    of the factors described in the section on "Employment Status." These       
    factors are primarily geographic differences between residence and          
    place of work, different dates of reference, and differences in             
    counts because of dual job holding. Industry data from population           
    censuses cover all industries and all kinds of workers, whereas, data       
    from establishments often excluded private household workers,               
    government workers, and the self-employed Also, the replies from            
    household respondents may have differed in detail and nature from           
    those obtained from establishments.                                         
                                                                                
    Occupation data from the census and data from government licensing          
    agencies, professional associations, trade unions, etc., may not be         
    as comparable as expected. Organizational listings often include            
    persons not in the labor force or persons devoting all or most of           
    their time to another occupation; or the same person may be included        
    in two or more different listings. In addition, relatively few              
    organizations, except for those requiring licensing, attained               
    complete coverage of membership in a particular occupational field.         
                                                                                
    JOURNEY TO WORK                                                             
                                                                                
    Place of Work                                                               
                                                                                
    The data on place of work were derived from answers to questionnaire        
    item 22, which was asked of persons who indicated in question 21 that       
    they worked at some time during the reference week. (For more               
    information, see discussion under "Reference Week.")                        
                                                                                
    Data were tabulated for workers 16 years and over; that is, members         
    of the Armed Forces and civilians who were at work during the               
    reference week. Data on place of work refer to the geographic               
    location at which workers carried out their occupational activities         
    during the reference week. The exact address (number and street) of         
    the place of work was asked, as well as the place (city, town, or           
    post office); whether or not the place of work was inside or outside        
    the limits of that city or town; and the county, State, and ZIP Code.       
    If the person's employer operated in more than one location, the            
    exact address of the location or branch where the respondent worked         
    was requested. When the number and street name were unknown, a              
    description of the location, such as the building name or nearest           
    street or intersection, was to be entered.                                  
                                                                                
    Persons who worked at more than one location during the reference           
    week were asked to report the one at which they worked the greatest         
    number of hours.  Persons who regularly worked in several locations         
    each day during the reference week were requested to give the address

    at which they began work each day. For cases in which daily work did        
    not begin at a central place each day, the person was asked to              
    provide as much information as possible to describe the area in which       
    he or she worked most during the reference week.                            
                                                                                
    In some tabulations, place-of-work locations may be defined as "in          
    area of residence" and "outside area of residence." The area of             
    residence may vary from table to table or even within a table, and          
    refers to the particular area or areas shown. For example, in a table       
    that provides data for counties, "in area of residence" refers to           
    persons who worked in the same county in which they lived, while            
    "outside area of residence" refers to persons whose workplace was           
    located in a county different from the one in which they lived.             
    Similarly, in a table that provides data for several types of areas,        
    such as the State and its individual metropolitan areas (MA's),             
    counties, and places, the place-of-work data will be vadable and is         
    determined by the geographic level (State, MA, county, or place)            
    shown in each section of the tabulation.                                    
                                                                                
    In tabulations that present data for States, workplaces for the             
    residents of the State may include, in addition to the State itself,        
    each contiguous State.  The category, "in noncontiguous State or            
    abroad," includes persons who worked in a State that did not border         
    their State of residence as well as persons who worked outside the          
    United States.                                                              
                                                                                
    In tabulations that present data for an MSA/PMSA, place-of-work             
    locations are specified to show the main destinations of workers            
    living in the MSA/PMSA. (For more information on metropolitan areas         
    (MA's), see Appendix A, Area Classifications.) All place-of-work            
    locations are identified with respect to the boundaries of the              
    MSA/PMSA as "inside MSA/PMSA" or "outside MSA/PMSA."  Locations             
    within the MSA/PMSA are further divided into each central city, and         
    each county or county balance. Selected large incorporated places           
    also may be specified as places of work.                                    
                                                                                
    Within New England MSA/ PMSA'S, the places of work presented                
    generally are cities and towns. Locations outside the MSA/PMSA are          
    specified if they are important commuting destinations for residents        
    of the MSA/ PMSA, and may include adjoining MSA/ PMSA's and their           
    central cities, their component counties, large incorporated places,        
    or counties, cities, or other geographic areas outside any MA. In           
    tabulations for MSA/PMSA's in New England; Honolulu, Hawaii; and            
    certain other MA's, some place-of-work locations are identified as          
    "areas" (e.g., Area 1, Area 5, Area 12, etc.). Such areas consist of        
    groups of towns, cities, census designated places (Honolulu MSA             
    only), or counties that have been identified as unique place-of-work        
    destinations. When an adjoining MSA/PMSA or MSA/PMSA remainder is           
    specified as a place-of-work location, its components are not defined       
    However, the components are presented in the 1990 CP-1, General             
    Population Characteristics for Metropolitan Areas and the 1990 CH -

    1, General Housing Characteristics for Metropolitan Areas reports. In       
    tabulations that present data for census tracts outside MA's,               
    place-of-work locations are defined as "in county of residence" and         
    "outside county of residence."                                              
                                                                                
    In areas where the workplace address was coded to the block level,          
    persons were tabulated as working inside or outside a specific place        
    based on the location of that address, regardless of the response to        
    question 22c concerning city/town limits. In areas where it was             
    impossible to code the workplace address to the block level, persons        
    were tabulated as working in a place if a place name was reported in        
    question 22b and the response to question 22c was either "Yes" or the       
    item was left blank. In selected areas, census designated places            
    (CDP's) may appear in the tabulations as places of work. The accuracy       
    of place-of-work data for CDP's may be affected by the extent to            
    which their census names were familiar to respondents, and by coding        
    problems caused by similarities between the CDP name and the names of       
    other geographic jurisdictions in the same vicinity.                        
                                                                                
    Place-of-work data are given for selected minor civil divisions             
    (generally, cities, towns, and townships) in the nine Northeastern          
    States, based on the responses to the place-of-work question. Many          
    towns and townships are regarded locally as equivalent to a place and       
    therefore, were reported as the place of work. When a respondent            
    reported a locality or incorporated place that formed a part of a           
    township or town, the coding and tabulating procedure was designed to       
    include the response in the total for the township or town. The             
    accuracy of the place-of-work data for minor civil divisions is             
    greatest for the New England States. However, the data for some New         
    England towns, for towns in New York, and for townships in New Jersey       
    and Pennsylvania may be affected by coding problems that resulted           
    from the unfamiliarity of the respondent with the minor civil               
    division in which the workplace was located or when a township and a        
    city or borough of the same or similar name are located close               
    together.                                                                   
                                                                                
    Place-of-work data may show a few workers who made unlikely daily           
    work trips (e.g., workers who lived in New York and worked in               
    California). This result is attributable to persons who worked during       
    the reference week at a location that was different from their usual        
    place of work, such as persons away from home on business.                  
                                                                                
    Comparability-The wording of the question on place of work was              
    substantially the same in the 1990 census as it was in 1980. However,       
    data on place of work from the 1990 census are based on the full            
    census sample, while data from the 1980 census were based on only           
    about one-half of the full sample.                                          
                                                                                
    For the 1980 census, nonresponse or incomplete responses to the             
    place-of-work question were not allocated, resulting in the use of          
    "not reported" categories in the 1980 publications. However, for the        
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      ICPSR 9952                                          Page 213              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    1990 census, when place of work was not reported or the response was        
    incomplete, a work location was allocated to the person based on            
    their means of transportation to work, travel time to work, industry,       
    and location of residence and workplace of others. The 1990                 
    publications, therefore, do not contain a "not reported" category for       
    the place-of-work data.                                                     
                                                                                
    Comparisons between 1980 and 1990 census data on the gross number of        
    workers in particular commuting flows, or the total number of persons       
    working in an area, should be made with extreme caution. Any apparent       
    increase in the magnitude of the gross numbers may be due solely to         
    the fact that for 1990 the "not reported" cases have been distributed       
    among specific place-of-work destinations, instead of tallied in a          
    separate category as in 1980.                                               
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data-The data on place of work relate to a                
    reference week; that is, the calendar week preceding the date on            
    which the respondents completed their questionnaires or were                
    interviewed by enumerators. This week is not the same for all               
    respondents because the enumeration was not completed in 1 week.            
    However, for the majority of persons, the reference week for the 1990       
    census is the last week in March 1990. The lack of a uniform                
    reference week means that the place-of-work data reported in the            
    census will not exactly match the distribution of workplace locations       
    observed or measured during an actual workweek.                             
                                                                                
    The place-of-work data are estimates of persons 16 years old and over       
    who were both employed and at work during the reference week                
    (including persons in the Armed Forces). Persons who did not work           
    during the reference week but had jobs or businesses from which they        
    were temporarily absent due to illness, bad weather, industrial             
    dispute, vacation, or other personal reasons are not included in the        
    place-of-work data. Therefore, the data on place of work understate         
    the total number of jobs or total employment in a geographic area           
    during the reference week. It also should be noted that persons who         
    had irregular, casual, or unstructured jobs during the reference week       
    may have erroneously reported themselves as not working.                    
                                                                                
    The address where the individual worked most often during the               
    reference week was recorded on the census questionnaire. If a worker        
    held two jobs, only data about the primary job (the one worked the          
    greatest number of hours during the preceding week) was requested.          
    Persons who regularly worked in several locations during the                
    reference week were requested to give the address at which they began       
    work each day. For cases in which daily work was not begun at a             
    central place each day, the person was asked to provide as much             
    information as possible to describe the area in which he or she             
    worked most during the reference week.

    The data on means of transportation to work were derived from answers       
    to questionnaire item 23a, which was asked of persons who indicated         
    in question 21 that they worked at some time during the reference           
    week. (For more information, see discussion under "Reference Week.")        
    Means of transportation to work refers to the principal mode of             
    travel or type of conveyance that the person usually used to get from       
    home to work during the reference week.                                     
                                                                                
    Persons who used different means of transportation on different days        
    of the week were asked to specify the one they used most often, that        
    is, the greatest number of days. Persons who used more than one means       
    of transportation to get to work each day were asked to report the          
    one used for the longest distance during the work trip. The category,       
    "Car, truck, or van," includes workers using a car (including company       
    cars but excluding taxicabs), a truck of one-ton capacity or less, or       
    a van. The category, "Public transportation," includes workers who          
    used a bus or trolley bus, streetcar or trolley car, subway or              
    elevated, railroad, ferryboat, or taxicab even if each mode is not          
    shown separately in the tabulation. The category, "Other means,"            
    includes workers who used a mode of travel which is not identified          
    separately within the data distribution. The category, "Other means,"       
    may vary from table to table, depending on the amount of detail shown       
    in a particular distribution.                                               
                                                                                
    The means of transportation data for some areas may show workers            
    using modes of public transportation that are not available in those        
    areas (e.g, subway or elevated riders in an MA where there actually         
    is no subway or elevated service). This result is largely due to            
    persons who worked during the reference week at a location that was         
    different from their usual place of work (such as persons away from         
    home on business in an area where subway service was available) and         
    persons who used more than one means of transportation each day but         
    whose principal means was unavailable where they lived (for example,        
    residents of nonmetropolitan areas who drove to the fringe of an MA         
    and took the commuter railroad most of the distance to work).               
                                                                                
    Private Vehicle Occupancy                                                   
                                                                                
    The data on private vehicle occupancy were derived from answers to          
    questionnaire item 23b. This question was asked of persons who              
    indicated in question 21 that they worked at some time during the           
    reference week and who reported in question 23a that their means of         
    transportation to work was "Car, truck, or van." (For more                  
    information, see discussion under "Reference Week.")                        
                                                                                
    Private vehicle occupancy refers to the number of persons who usually       
    rode to work in the vehicle during the reference week. The category,        
    "Drove alone," includes persons who usually drove alone to work as          
    well as persons who were driven to work by someone who then drove           
    back home or to a nonwork destination.  The category, "Carpooled,"          
    includes workers who reported that two or more persons usually rode

    Persons Per Car, Truck, or Van-This is obtained by dividing the             
    number of persons who reported using a car, truck, or van to get to         
    work by the number of such vehicles that they used. The number of           
    vehicles used is derived by counting each person who drove alone as         
    one vehicle, each person who reported being in a two-person carpool         
    as one-half vehicle, each person who reported being in a three-person       
    carpool as one-third vehicle, and so on, and then summing all the           
    vehicles.

    The data on time leaving home to go to work were derived from answers       
    to questionnaire item 24a. This question was asked of persons who           
    indicated in question 21 that they worked at some time during the           
    reference week and who reported in question 23a that they worked            
    outside their home. The departure time refers to the time of day that       
    the person usually left home to go to work during the reference week.

    The data on travel time to work were derived from answers to                
    questionnaire item 24b. This question was asked of persons who              
    indicated in question 21 that they worked at some time during the           
    reference week and who reported in question 23a that they worked            
    outside their home. Travel time to work refers to the total number of       
    minutes that it usually took the person to get from home to work            
    during the reference week. The elapsed time includes time spent             
    waiting for public transportation, picking up passengers in carpools,       
    and time spent in other activities related to getting to work. (For

    Data on language spoken at home were derived from the answers to            
    questionnaire items 15a and 15b, which were asked of a sample of            
    persons born before April 1, 1985. Instructions mailed with the 1990        
    census questionnaire stated that a respondent should mark "Yes" in          
    question 15a if the person sometimes or always spoke a language other       
    than English at home and should not mark "Yes" if a language was            
    spoken only at school or if speaking was limited to a few expressions       
    or slang. For question 15b, respondents were instructed to print the        
    name of the non-English language spoken at home. If the person spoke        
    more than one language other than English, the person was to report         
    the language spoken more often or the language learned first.

    which provided a telephone number for respondents to call to request        
    a census questionnaire and instructions in Spanish. Instruction             
    guides were also available in 32 other languages to assist                  
    enumerators who encountered households or respondents who spoke no          
    English.                                                                    
                                                                                
    Questions 15a and 15b referred to languages spoken at home in an            
    effort to measure the current use of languages other than English.          
    Persons who knew languages other than English but did not use them          
    at home or who only used them elsewhere were excluded Persons who           
    reported speaking a language other than English at home may also            
    speak English; however, the questions did not permit determination of       
    the main or dominant language of persons who spoke both English and         
    another language. (For more information, see discussion below on            
    "Ability to Speak English.")                                                
                                                                                
    For persons who indicated that they spoke a language other than             
    English at home in question 15a, but failed to specify the name of          
    the language in question 15b, the language was assigned based on the        
    language of other speakers in the household; on the language of a           
    person of the same Spanish origin or detailed race group living in          
    the same or a nearby area; or on a person of the same ancestry or           
    place of birth. In all cases where a person was assigned a                  
    non-English language, it was assumed that the language was spoken at        
    home.  Persons for whom the name of a language other than English was       
    entered in question 15b, and for whom question 15a was blank were           
    assumed to speak that language at home.                                     
                                                                                
    The write-in responses listed in question 15b (specific language            
    spoken) were transcribed onto computer files and coded into more than       
    380 detailed language categories using an automated coding system,          
    The automated procedure compared write-in responses reported by             
    respondents with entries in a computer dictionary, which initially          
    contained approximately 2,000 language names. The dictionary was            
    updated with a large number of new names, variations in spelling, and       
    a small number of residual categories. Each write-in response was           
    given a numeric code that was associated with one of the detailed           
    categories in the dictionary. If the respondent listed more than one        
    non-English language, only the first was coded.                             
                                                                                
    The write-in responses represented the names people used for                
    languages they speak. They may not match the names or categories used       
    by linguists. The sets of categories used are sometimes geographic          
    and sometimes linguistic. Figure 1 provides an illustration of the          
    content of the classification schemes used to present language data.

    Ability to Speak English                                                    
                                                                                
    Persons 5 years old and over who reported that they spoke a language        
    other than English in question 15a were also asked in question 15c to       
    indicate their ability to speak English based on one of the following       
    categories: "very well," Well,""Not well," or "Not at all."                 
                                                                                
    The data on ability to speak English represents the person's own            
    perception about his or her own ability or, because census                  
    questionnaires are usually completed by one household member, the           
    responses may represent the perception of another household member.         
    The instruction guides and questionnaires that were mailed to               
    households did not include any information on how to interpret the          
    response categories in question 15c.                                        
                                                                                
    Persons who reported that they spoke a language other than English at       
    home but whose ability to speak English was not reported, were              
    assigned the English-language ability of a randomly selected person         
    of the same age, Spanish origin, nativity and year of entry, and            
    language group.                                                             
                                                                                
    Linguistic isolation-A household in which no person age 14 years or         
    over speaks only English and no person age 14 years or over who             
    speaks a language other than English speaks English "Very well" is          
    classified as "linguistically isolated." All the member's of a              
    linguistically isolated household are tabulated as linguistically           
    isolated, including members under age 14 years who may speak only           
    English.                                                                    
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data-Persons who speak a language other than              
    English at home may have first learned that language at school.             
    However, these persons would be expected to indicate that they spoke        
    English "Very well." Persons who speak a language other than English,       
    but do not do so at home, should have been reported as not speaking a       
    language other than English at home.                                        
                                                                                
    The extreme detail in which language names were coded may give a            
    false impression of the linguistic precision of these data. The names       
    used by speakers of a language to identify it may reflect ethnic,           
    geographic, or political affiliations and do not necessarily respect        
    linguistic distinctions.  The categories shown in the tabulations           
    were chosen on a number of criteria, such as information about the          
    number of speakers of each language that might be expected in a             
    sample of the United States population. Comparability-Information on        
    language has been collected in every census since 1890. The                 
    comparability of data among censuses is limited by changes in               
    question wording, by the subpopulations to whom the question was            
    addressed, and by the detail that was published.                            
                                                                                
    The same question on language was asked in the 1980 and 1990                
    censuses. This question on the current language spoken at home

    replaced the questions asked in prior censuses on mother tongue; that       
    is, the language other than English spoken in the person's home when        
    he or she was a child; one's first language; or the language spoken         
    before immigrating to the United States. The censuses of 1910-1940,         
    1960 and 1970 included questions on mother tongue. A change in coding       
    procedure from 1980 to 1990 should have improved accuracy of coding         
    and may affect the number of persons reported in some of the 380 plus       
    categories. It should not greatly affect the 4-group or 25 group            
    lists. In 1980, coding clerks supplied numeric codes for the written        
    entries on each questionnaire using a 2,000 name reference list. In         
    1990 written entries were transcribed to a computer file and matched        
    to a computer dictionary which began with the 2,000 name list, but          
    expanded as unmatched names were referred to headquarters specialists       
    for resolution.                                                             
                                                                                
    The question on ability to speak English was asked for the first time       
    in 1980.  In tabulations from 1980, the categories "Very well" and          
    "Well" were combined.  Data from other surveys suggested a major            
    difference between the category "Very well" and the remaining               
    categories. In tabulations showing ability to speak English, persons        
    who reported that they spoke English "Very well" are presented              
    separately from persons who reported their ability to speak English         
    as less than "Very well."                                                   
                                                                                
    MARITAL STATUS                                                              
                                                                                
    The data on marital status were derived from answers to questionnaire       
    item 6, which was asked of all persons. The marital status                  
    classification refers to the status at the time of enumeration. Data        
    on marital status are tabulated only for persons 15 years old and           
    over.                                                                       
                                                                                
    All persons were asked whether they were "now married," "widowed,"          
    "divorced," "separated," or "never married." Couples who live               
    together (unmarried persons, persons in common-law marriages) were          
    allowed to report the marital status they considered the most               
    appropriate.                                                                
                                                                                
    Never Married-Includes all persons who have never been married,             
    including persons whose only marriage(s) was annulled.                      
                                                                                
    Ever Married-Includes persons married at the time of enumeration            
    (including those separated, widowed, or divorced.                           
                                                                                
    Now Married, Except Separated-Includes persons whose current marriage       
    has not ended through widowhood, divorce, or separation (regardless         
    of previous marital history). The category may also include couples         
    who live together or persons in common-law marriages if they consider       
    this category the most appropriate. In certain tabulations, currently       
    married persons are further classified as "spouse present" or "spouse       
    absent."

    Separated-Includes persons legally separated or otherwise absent from       
    their spouse because of marital discord. Included are persons who           
    have been deserted or who have parted because they no longer want to        
    live together but who have not obtained a divorce.

    Divorced-Includes persons who are legally divorced and who have not         
    remarried.                                                                  
                                                                                
    In selected sample tabulations, data for married and separated              
    persons are reorganized and combined with information on the presence       
    of the spouse in the same household.                                        
                                                                                
    Now Married-All persons whose current marriage has not ended by             
    widowhood or divorce. This category includes persons defined above as       
    "separated."                                                                
                                                                                
        Spouse Present-Married persons whose wife or                            
        husband was enumerated as a member of the same                          
        household, including those whose spouse may have                        
        been temporarily absent for such reasons as travel or                   
        hospitalization.                                                        
                                                                                
        Spouse Absent-Married persons whose wife or                             
        husband was not enumerated as a member of the                           
        same household. This category also includes all                         
        married persons living in group quarters.

        Spouse Absent, Other-Married persons whose wife                         
        or husband was not enumerated as a member of the                        
        same household, excluding separated, Included is                        
        any person whose spouse was employed and living                         
        away from home or in an institution or absent in the                    
        Armed Forces.                                                           
                                                                                
    Differences between the number of currently married males and the           
    number of currently married females occur because of reporting              
    differences and because some husbands and wives have their usual            
    residence in different areas. In sample tabulations, these                  
    differences can also occur because different weights are applied to         
    the individual's data. Any differences between the number of "now           
    married, spouse present" males and females are due solely to sample         
    weighting. By definition, the number's would be the same.                   
                                                                                
    When marital status was not reported, it was imputed according to the       
    relationship to the householder and sex and age of the person.              
                                                                                
    Comparability-The 1990 marital status definitions are the same as           
    those used in 1980 with the exception of the term "never married"

    which replaces the term 1.  single" in tabulations. A general marital       
    status question has been asked in every census since 1880.                  
                                                                                
    MOBILITY LIMITATION STATUS                                                  
                                                                                
    The data on mobility limitation status were derived from answers to         
    questionnaire item 19a, which was asked of a sample of persons 15           
    years old and over.                                                         
                                                                                
    Persons were identified as having a mobility limitation if they had a       
    health condition that had lasted for 6 or more months and which made        
    it difficult to go outside the home alone. Examples of outside              
    activities on the questionnaire included shopping and visiting the          
    doctor's office.                                                            
                                                                                
    The term "health condition" referred to both physical and mental            
    conditions. A temporary health problem, such as a broken bone that          
    was expected to heal normally, was not considered a health condition.       
                                                                                
    Comparability-This was the first time that a question on mobility           
    limitation was included in the census.                                      
                                                                                
    PLACE OF BIRTH                                                              
                                                                                
    The data on place of birth were derived from answers to questionnaire       
    item 8, which was asked on a sample basis. The place-of-birth               
    question asked respondents to report the U.S. State, commonwealth or        
    territory, or the foreign country where they were born. Persons born        
    outside the United States were asked to report their place of birth         
    according to current international boundaries.  Since numerous              
    changes in boundaries of foreign countries have occurred in the last        
    century, some persons may have reported their place of birth in terms       
    of boundaries that existed at the time of their birth or emigration,        
    or in accordance with their own national preference.                        
                                                                                
    Persons not reporting place of birth were assigned the birthplace of        
    another family member or were allocated the response of another             
    person with similar characteristics. Persons allocated as foreign           
    born were not assigned a specific country of birth but were                 
    classified as "Born abroad, country not specified."                         
                                                                                
    Nativity-information on place of birth and citizenship were used to         
    classify the population into two major categories: native and foreign       
    born. When information on place of birth was not reported, nativity         
    was assigned on the basis of answers to citizenship, if reported, and       
    other characteristics.                                                      
                                                                                
    Native-Includes persons born in the United States, Puerto Rico, or an       
    outlying area of the United States. The small number of persons who

    The native population is classified in the following groups: persons        
    born in the State in which they resided at the time of the census;          
    persons born in a different State, by region; persons born in Puerto        
    Rico or an outlying area of the U.S.; and persons born abroad with at       
    least one American parent.                                                  
                                                                                
    Foreign Born-Includes persons not classified as "Native." Prior to          
    the 1970 census, persons not reporting place of birth were generally        
    classified as native.                                                       
                                                                                
    The foreign-born population is shown by selected area, country, or          
    region of birth: the places of birth shown in data products were            
    selected based on the number of respondents who reported that area or       
    country of birth.                                                           
                                                                                
    Comparability-Data on the State of birth of the native population           
    have been collected in each census beginning with that of 1850.             
    Similar data were shown in tabulations for the 1980 census and other        
    recent censuses. Nonresponse was allocated in a similar manner in           
    1980; however, prior to 1980, nonresponse to the place of birth             
    question was not allocated. Prior to the 1970 census, persons not           
    reporting place of birth were generally classified as native.               
                                                                                
    The questionnaire instruction to report mother's State of residence         
    instead of the person's actual State of birth (if born in a hospital        
    in a different State) was dropped in 1990. Evaluation studies of 1970       
    and 1980 census data demonstrated that this instruction was generally       
    either ignored or misunderstood. Since the hospital and the mother's        
    residence is in the same State for most births, this change may have        
    a slight effect on State of birth data for States with large                
    metropolitan areas that straddle State lines.                               
                                                                                
    POVERTY STATUS IN 1989                                                      
                                                                                
    The data on poverty status were derived from answers to the same            
    questions as the income data, questionnaire items 32 and 33. (For           
    more information, see the discussion under "Income in 1989.") Poverty       
    statistics presented in census publications were based on a                 
    definition originated by the Social Security Administration in 1964         
    and subsequently modified by Federal interagency committees in 1969         
    and 1980 and prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget in           
    Directive 14 as the standard to be used by Federal agencies for             
    statistical purposes.                                                       
                                                                                
    At the core of this definition was the 1961 economy food plan, the          
    least costly of four nutritionally adequate food plans designed by          
    the Department of Agriculture. It was determined from the Agriculture       
    Department's 1955 survey of food consumption that families of three         
    or more persons spend approximately one-third of their income on            
    food; hence, the poverty level for these families was set at three          
    times the cost of the economy food plan. For smaller families and

    persons living alone, the cost of the economy food plan was                 
    multiplied by factors that were slightly higher to compensate for the       
    relatively larger fixed expenses for these smaller households.              
                                                                                
    The income cutoffs used by the Census Bureau to determine the poverty       
    status of families and unrelated individuals included a set of 48           
    thresholds arranged in a two-dimensional matrix consisting of family        
    size (from one person to nine or more persons) cross-classified by          
    presence and number of family members under 18 years old (from no           
    children present to eight or more children present).  Unrelated             
    individuals and two-person families were further differentiated by          
    age of the householder (under 65 years old and 65 years old and             
    over).                                                                      
                                                                                
    The total income of each family or unrelated individual in the sample       
    was tested against the appropriate poverty threshold to determine the       
    poverty status of that family or unrelated individual. If the total         
    income was less than the corresponding cutoff, the family or                
    unrelated individual was classified as "below the poverty level." The       
    number of persons below the poverty level was the sum of the number         
    of persons in families with incomes below the poverty level and the         
    number of unrelated individuals with incomes below the poverty level.       
                                                                                
    The poverty thresholds are revised annually to allow for changes in         
    the cost of living as reflected in the Consumer Price Index. The            
    average poverty threshold for a family of four persons was $12,674 in       
    1989, (For more information see table A below.)

    determined for all persons except institutionalized persons, persons        
    in military group quarters and in college dormitories, and unrelated        
    individuals under 15 years old. These groups also were excluded from        
    the denominator when calculating poverty rates. Specified Poverty           
    Levels-Since the poverty levels currently in use by the Federal             
    Government do not meet all the needs of data user, some of the data         
    are presented for alternate levels. These specified poverty levels          
    are obtained by multiplying the income cutoffs at the poverty level         
    by the appropriate factor. For example, the average income cutoff at        
    125 percent of poverty level was $15,843 ($12,674 x 1.25) in 1989 for       
    a family of four persons.                                                   
                                                                                
    Weighted Average Thresholds at the Poverty Level-The average                
    thresholds shown in the first column of table A are weighted by the         
    presence and number of children. For example, the weighted average          
    threshold for a given family size is obtained by multiplying the            
    threshold for each presence and number of children category within          
    the given family size by the number of families in that category.           
    These products are then aggregated across the entire range of               
    presence and number of children categories, and the aggregate is            
    divided by the total number of families in the group to yield the           
    weighted average threshold at the poverty level for that family size.       
                                                                                
    Since the basic thresholds used to determine the poverty status of          
    families and unrelated individuals are applied to all families and          
    unrelated individuals, the weighted average poverty thresholds are          
    derived using all families and unrelated individuals rather than just       
    those classified as being below the poverty level. To obtain the            
    weighted poverty thresholds for families and unrelated individuals          
    below alternate poverty levels, the weighted thresholds shown in            
    table A may be multiplied directly by the appropriate factor. The           
    weighted average thresholds presented in the table are based on the         
    March 1990 Current Population Survey. However, these thresholds would       
    not differ significantly from those based on the 1990 census.               
                                                                                
    Income Deficit-Represents the difference between the total income of        
    families and unrelated individuals below the poverty level and their        
    respective poverty thresholds. In computing the income deficit,             
    families reporting a net income loss are assigned zero dollars and          
    for such cases the deficit is equal to the poverty threshold.               
                                                                                
    This measure provided an estimate of the amount which would be              
    required to raise the incomes of all poor families and unrelated            
    individuals to their respective poverty thresholds. The income              
    deficit is thus a measure of the degree of impoverishment of a family       
    or unrelated individual. However, caution must be used in comparing         
    the average deficits of families with different characteristics.            
    Apparent differences in average income deficits may, to some extent,        
    be a function of differences in family size.                                
                                                                                
    Mean income Deficit-Represents the amount obtained by dividing the

    Comparability-The poverty definition used in the 1990 and 1980              
    censuses differed slightly from the one used in the 1 970 census.           
    Three technical modifications were made to the definition used in the       
    1970 census as described below:                                             
                                                                                
        1. The separate thresholds for families with a female                   
           householder with no husband present and all other                    
           families were eliminated. For the 1980 and 1990                      
           censuses, the weighted average of the poverty                        
           thresholds for these two types of families was                       
           applied to all types of families, regardless of the sex              
           of the householder.                                                  
                                                                                
        2. Farm families and farm unrelated individuals no                      
           longer had a set of poverty thresholds that were                     
           lower than the thresholds applied to nonfarm fam-                    
           ilies and unrelated individuals. The farm thresholds                 
           were 85 percent of the corresponding levels for                      
           nonfarm families in the 1970 census. The same                        
           thresholds were applied to all families and unre-                    
           lated individuals regardless of residence in 1980                    
           and 1990.                                                            
                                                                                
        3. The thresholds by size of family were extended                       
           from seven or more persons in 1 970 to nine or more                  
           persons in 1980 and 1990,                                            
                                                                                
    These changes resulted in a minimal increase in the number of poor at       
    the national level. For a complete discussion of these modifications        
    and their impact, see the Current Population Reports, Series P-60,          
    No. 133.                                                                    
                                                                                
    The population covered in the poverty statistics derived from the           
    1980 and 1990 censuses was essentially the same as in the 1970              
    census. The only difference was that in 1980 and 1990, unrelated            
    individuals under 15 years old were excluded from the poverty               
    universe, while in 1970, only those under 14 years old were excluded.       
    The poverty data from the 1960 census excluded all persons in group         
    quarters and included all unrelated individuals regardless of age. It       
    was unlikely that these differences in population coverage would have       
    had significant impact when comparing the poverty data for persons          
    since the 1960 censuses.                                                    
                                                                                
    Current Population Survey-Because of differences in the                     
    questionnaires and data collection procedures, estimates of the             
    number of persons below the poverty level by various characteristics        
    from the 1990 census may differ from those reported in the March 1990       
    Current Population Survey.

    RACE                                                                        
                                                                                
    The data on race were derived from answers to questionnaire item 4,         
    which was asked of all persons. The concept of race as used by the          
    Census Bureau reflects self-identification; it does not denote any          
    clearcut scientific definition of biological stock. The data for race       
    represent self-classification by people according to the race with          
    which they most closely identity. Furthermore, it is recognized that        
    the categories of the race item include both racial and national            
    origin or sociocultural groups.                                             
                                                                                
    During direct interviews conducted by enumerators, if a person could        
    not provide a single response to the race question, he or she was           
    asked to select, based on self-identification, the group which best         
    described his or her racial identity. If a person could not provide a       
    single race response, the race of the mother was used. If a single          
    race response could not be provided for the person's mother, the            
    first race reported by the person was used. In all cases where              
    occupied housing units, households, or families are classified by           
    race, the race of the householder was used.                                 
                                                                                
    The racial classification used by the Census Bureau generally adheres       
    to the guidelines in Federal Statistical Directive No. 15, issued by        
    the Office of Management and Budget, which provides standards on            
    ethnic and racial categories for statistical reporting to be used by        
    all Federal agencies. The racial categories used in the 1990 census         
    data products are provided below.

    American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut-includes persons who classified

        American Indian Tribe-Persons who identified                            
        themselves as American Indian were asked to                             
        report their enrolled or principal tribe. Therefore,                    
        tribal data in tabulations reflect the written tribal                   
        entries reported on the questionnaires.

        The information on tribe is based on self-identification                
        and therefore does not reflect any designation of                       
        Federally- or State-recognized tribe. Information

    Written entries to three categories on the race item"Indian (Amer.),"       
    "Other Asian or Pacific Islander (API)," and "Other race"-were              
    reviewed, edited, and coded by subject matter specialists. (For more        
    information on the coding operation, see the section below that             
    discusses "Comparability.")                                                 
                                                                                
    The written entries under "Indian (Amer.)" and "Other Asian or              
    Pacific Islander (API)" were reviewed and coded during 100-percent          
    processing of the 1990 census questionnaires. A substantial portion         
    of the entries for the "Other race" category also were reviewed,            
    edited, and coded during the 100-percent processing The remaining           
    entries under "Other race" underwent review and coding during sample        
    processing. Most of the written entries reviewed and coded during           
    sample processing were those indicating Hispanic origin such as             
    Mexican, Cuban, or Puerto Rican.'                                           
                                                                                
    If the race entry for a member of a household was missing on the            
    questionnaire, race was assigned based upon the reported entries of         
    race by other household members using specific rules of precedence of       
    household relationship. For example, if race was missing for the            
    daughter of the householder, then the race of her mother (as female         
    householder or female spouse) would be assigned. If there was no            
    female householder or spouse in the household, the daughter would be        
    assigned her father's (male householder) race. If race was not              
    reported for anyone in the household, the race of a householder in a        
    previously processed household was assigned. This procedure is a            
    variation of the general imputation procedures described in Appendix        
    C, Accuracy of the Data.                                                    
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data-In the 1980 census, a relatively high                
    proportion (20 percent) of American Indians did not report any tribal       
    entry in the race item.  Evaluation of the pre-census tests indicated       
    that changes made for the 1990 race item should improve the reporting       
    of tribes in the rural areas (especially on reservations) for the           
    1990 census. The results for urban areas were inconclusive. Also, the       
    precensus tests indicated that there may be overreporting of the            
    Cherokee tribe, An evaluation of 1980 census data showed                    
    overreporting of Cherokee in urban areas or areas where the number of       
    American Indians was sparse.

    In the 1990 census, respondents sometimes did not fill in a circle or       
    filled the "Other race" circle and wrote in a response, such as Arab,       
    Polish, or African American in the shared write-in box for "Other           
    race" and "Other API" responses. During the automated coding process,       
    these responses were edited and assigned to the appropriate racial          
    designation. Also, some Hispanic origin persons did not fill in a           
    circle, but provided entries such as Mexican or Puerto Rican. These         
    persons were classified in the "Other race" category during the             
    coding and editing process. There may be some minor differences             
    between sample data and 100-percent data because sample processing          
    included additional edits not included in the percent processing.

    Comparability-Differences between the 1990 census and earlier               
    censuses affect the comparability of data for certain racial groups         
    and American Indian tribes.  The 1990 census was the first census to        
    undertake, on a 100-percent basis, an automated review, edit, and           
    coding operation for written responses to the race item. The                
    automated coding system used in the 1990 census greatly reduced the         
    potential for error associated with a clerical review. Specialists          
    with a thorough knowledge of the race subject matter reviewed,              
    edited, coded, and resolved inconsistent or incomplete responses. In        
    the 1980 census, there was only a limited clerical review of the race       
    responses on the 100-percent forms with a full clerical review              
    conducted only on the sample questionnaires.                                
                                                                                
    Another major difference between the 1990 and preceding censuses is         
    the handling of the write-in responses for the Asian or Pacific             
    Islander populations. In addition to the nine Asian or Pacific              
    Islander categories shown on the questionnaire under the spanner            
    provided a new residual category, "Other API," for Asian or Pacific         
    Islander persons who did not report in one of the listed Asian or           
    Pacific Islander groups. During the coding operation, write-in              
    responses for "Other API" were reviewed, coded, and assigned to the         
    appropriate classification. For example, in 1990, a write-in entry of       
    Laotian, Thai, or Javanese is classified as "Other Asian," while a          
    write-in entry of Tongan or Fijian is classified as "Other Pacific          
    Islander." In the 1990 census, these persons were able to identity as       
    "Other API" in both the 100-percent and sample operations.                  
                                                                                
    In the 1980 census, the nine Asian or Pacific Islander groups were          
    also listed separately. However, persons not belonging to these nine        
    groups wrote in their specific racial group under the "Other" race          
    category. Persons with a written entry such as Laotian, Thai, or            
    Tongan, were tabulated and published as "Other race" in the                 
    100-percent processing operation in 1980, but were reclassified as          
    "Other Asian and Pacific Islander" in 1980 sample tabulations. In           
    1980 special reports on the Asian or Pacific Islander populations,          
    data were shown separately for "Other Asian" and "Other Pacific             
    Islander."                                                                  
                                                                                
    The 1970 questionnaire did not have separate race categories for            
    Asian Indian, Vietnamese, Samoan, and Guamanian. These persons              
    indicated their race in the "Other" category and later, through the         
    editing process, were assigned to a specific group. For example, in         
    1970, Asian Indians were reclassified as "White," while Vietnamese,         
    Guamanians, and Samoans were included in the "Other' category.              
                                                                                
    Another difference between 1990 and preceding censuses is the               
    approach taken when persons of Spanish/Hispanic origin did not report       
    in a specific race category but reported as "Other race" or "Other."        
    These persons commonly provided a write-in entry such as Mexican,           
    Venezuelan, or Latino. In the 1990 and 1980 censuses, these entries         
    remained in the "Other race" or "Other' category, respectively. In

    the 1970 census, most of these persons were included in the "White"         
    category.                                                                   
                                                                                
    REFERENCE WEEK                                                              
                                                                                
    The data on labor force status and journey to work were related to          
    the reference week; that is, the calendar week preceding the date on        
    which respondents completed their questionnaires or were interviewed        
    by enumerators.  This week is not the same for all respondents since        
    the enumeration was not completed in one week. The occurrence of            
    holidays during the enumeration period could affect the data on             
    actual hours worked during the reference week, but probably had no          
    effect on overall measurement of employment status (see the                 
    discussion below on "Comparability").                                       
                                                                                
    Comparability-The reference weeks for the 1990 and 1980 censuses            
    differ in that Passover and Good Friday occurred in the first week of       
    April 1980, but in the second week of April 1990. Many workers              
    presumably took time off for those observances. The differing               
    occurrence of these holidays could affect the comparability of the          
    1990 and 1980 data on actual hours worked for some areas if the             
    respective weeks were the reference weeks for a significant number of       
    persons. The holidays probably did not affect the overall measurement       
    of employment status since this information was based on work               
    activity during the entire reference week.                                  
                                                                                
    RESIDENCE IN 1985                                                           
                                                                                
    The data on residence in 1985 were derived from answers to question         
    14b, which asked for the State (or foreign country), county, and            
    place of residence on April 1, 1985 for those persons reporting in          
    question 14a that on that date they lived in a different house than         
    their current residence. Residence in 1985 is used in conjunction           
    with location of current residence to determine the extent of               
    residential mobility of the population and the resulting                    
    redistribution of the population across the various States,                 
    metropolitan areas, and regions of the country.                             
                                                                                
    When no information on residence in 1985 was reported for a person,         
    information for other family members, if available, was used to             
    assign a location of residence in 1985. All cases of nonresponse or         
    incomplete response that were not assigned a previous residence based       
    on information from other family members were allocated the                 
    previous residence of another person with similar characteristics who       
    provided complete information.                                              
                                                                                
    The tabulation category, "Same house," includes all persons 5 years         
    old and over who did not move during the 5 years as well as those who       
    had moved but by 1990 had returned to their 1985 residence. The             
    category, "Different house in the United States," includes persons          
    who lived in the United States in 1985 but in a different house or

    apartment from the one they occupied on April 1, 1990. These movers         
    are then further subdivided according to the type of move.                  
                                                                                
    In most tabulations, movers are divided into three groups according         
    to their 1985 residence: "Different house, same county," "Different         
    county, same State," and "Different State." The last group may be           
    further subdivided into region of residence in 1985. The category,          
    "Abroad," includes those persons who were residing in a foreign             
    country, Puerto Rico, or an outlying area of the U.S.  in 1985,             
    including members of the Armed Forces and their dependents. Some            
    tabulations show movers who were residing in Puerto Rico or an              
    outlying area in 1985 separately from those residing in other               
    countries.                                                                  
                                                                                
    In tabulations for metropolitan areas, movers are categorized               
    according to the metropolitan status of their current and previous          
    residences, resulting in such groups as movers within an MSA/PMSA,          
    movers between MSA/ PMSA's, movers from nonmetropolitan areas to            
    MSA/PMSA, and movers from central cities to the remainder of an MSA/        
    PMSA. In some tabulations, these categories are further subdivided by       
    size of MSA/ PMSA, region of current or previous residence, or movers       
    within or between central cities and the remainder of the same or a         
    different MSA/ PMSA.                                                        
                                                                                
    The size categories used in some tabulations for both 1985 and 1990         
    residence refer to the populations of the MSA/ PMSA on April 1, 1990;       
    that is, at the end of the migration interval.                              
                                                                                
    Some tabulations present data on inmigrants, outmigrants, and net           
    migration.  "Inmigrants" are generally defined as those persons who         
    entered a specified area by crossing its boundary from some point           
    outside the area. In some tabulations, movers from abroad are               
    included in the number of inmigrants; in others, only movers within         
    the United States are included.                                             
                                                                                
    "Outmigrants" are persons who depart from a specific area by crossing       
    its boundary to a point outside it, but without leaving the United          
    States. "Net migration" is calculated by subtracting the number of          
    outmigrants from the number of inmigrants and, depending upon the           
    particular tabulation, may or may not include movers from abroad. The       
    net migration for the area is net inmigration if the result was             
    positive and net outmigration if the result was negative. In the            
    tabulations, net outmigration is indicated by a minus sign (-).             
                                                                                
    Inmigrants and outmigrants for States include only those persons who        
    did not live in the same State in 1985 and 1990; that is, they              
    exclude persons who moved between counties within the same State.           
    Thus, the sum of the inmigrants to (or outmigrants from) all counties       
    in any State is greater than the number of inmigrants to (or                
    outmigrants from) that State. However, in the case of net migration,        
    the sum of the nets for all the countries within a State equal the          
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      Page 238                                          ICPSR 9952              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    net for the State. In the same fashion, the net migration for a             
    division or region equals the sum of the nets for the States                
    comprising that division or region, while the number of inmigrants          
    and outmigrants for that division or region is less than the sum of         
    the inmigrants or outmigrants for the individual States.                    
                                                                                
    The number of persons who were living in a different house in 1985 is       
    somewhat less than the total number of moves during the 5-year period.      
    Some persons in the same house at the two dates had moved during the        
    5-year period but by the time of the census had returned to their           
    1985 residence. Other persons who were living in a different house          
    had made one or more intermediate moves. For similar reasons, the           
    number of persons living in a different county, MSA/PMSA, or State or       
    moving between nonmetropolitan areas may be understated.                    
                                                                                
    Comparability-Similar questions were asked on all previous censuses         
    beginning in 1940, except the questions in 1950 referred to residence       
    1 year earlier rather than 5 years earlier. Although the questions in       
    the 1940 census covered a 5-year period, comparability with that            
    census was reduced somewhat because of different definitions and            
    categories of tabulation. Comparability with the 1960 and 1970 census       
    is also somewhat reduced because nonresponse was not allocated in           
    those earlier censuses. For the 1980 census, nonresponse was                
    allocated in a manner similar to the 1990 allocation scheme.                
                                                                                
    SCHOOL ENROLLMENT AND LABOR FORCE STATUS                                    
                                                                                
    Tabulation of data on enrollment, educational attainment, and labor         
    force status for the population 16 to 19 years old allows for               
    calculation of the proportion of the age group who are not enrolled         
    in school and not high school graduates or "dropouts" and an                
    unemployment rate for the "dropouts" population.  Definitions of the        
    three topics and descriptions of the census items from which they           
    were derived are presented in "Educational Attainment," "Employment         
    Status," and "School Enrollment and Type of School." The published          
    tabulations include both the civilian and Armed Forces populations,         
    but labor force status is provided for the civilian Population only.        
    Therefore, the component labor force statuses may not add to the            
    total lines enrolled in school, high school graduate, and not high          
    school graduate. The difference is Armed Forces.                            
                                                                                
    Comparability-The tabulation of school enrollment by labor force            
    status is similar to that published in 1980 census reports. The 1980        
    census tabulation included a single data line for Armed Forces;             
    however, enrollment, attainment, and labor force status data were           
    shown for the civilian population only. In 1970, a tabulation was           
    included for 16 to 21 year old males not attending school.                  
                                                                                
    SCHOOL ENROLLMENT AND TYPE OF SCHOOL                                        
                                                                                
    Data on school enrollment were derived from answers to questionnaire

    item 11, which was asked of a sample of persons. Persons were               
    classified as enrolled in school if they reported attending a               
    "regular public or private school or college at any time between            
    February 1, 1990 and the time of enumeration. The question included         
    instructions to "include only nursery school, kindergarten,                 
    elementary school, and schooling which would lead to a high school          
    diploma or a college degree" as regular school. Instructions included       
    in the 1990 respondent instruction guide, which was mailed with the         
    census questionnaire, further specified that enrollment in a trade or       
    business school, company training, or tutoring were not to be               
    included unless the course would be accepted for credit at a regular        
    elementary school, high school, or college. Persons who did not             
    answer the enrollment question were assigned the enrollment status          
    and type of school of a person with the same age, race or Hispanic          
    origin, and at older ages, sex, whose residence was in the same or a        
    nearby area.                                                                
                                                                                
    Public and Private School-Includes persons who attended school in the       
    reference period and indicated they were enrolled by marking one of         
    the questionnaire categories for ether "public school, public               
    college" or "private school, private college." The instruction guide        
    defines a public school as "any school or college controlled and            
    supported by a local, county, State, or Federal Government." "Schools       
    supported and controlled primarily by religious organizations or            
    other private groups" are defined as private. Persons who filled both       
    the "public" and "private" circles are edited to the first entry,           
    "public." Level of School in Which Enrolled-Persons who were enrolled       
    in school were classified as enrolled in preprimary school,"                
    "elementary or high school," or college" according to their response        
    to question 12 (years of school completed or highest degree                 
    received). Persons who were enrolled and reported completing nursery        
    school or less were classified as enrolled in "preprimary school,"          
    which includes kindergarten. Similarly, enrolled persons who had            
    completed at least kindergarten, but not high school, were classified       
    as enrolled in elementary or high school. Enrolled persons who              
    reported completing high school or some college or having received a        
    post-secondary degree were classified as enrolled in "college."             
    Enrolled persons who reported completing the twelfth grade but              
    receiving "NO DIPLOMA" were classified as enrolled in high school.          
    (For more information on level of school, see the discussion under          
    "Educational Attainment.")                                                  
                                                                                
    Comparability-School enrollment questions have been included in the         
    census since 1840; grade attended was first asked in 1940; type of          
    school was first asked in 1960. Before 1940, the enrollment question        
    in various censuses referred to attendance in the preceding six             
    months or the preceding year. In 1940, the reference was to                 
    attendance in the month preceding the census, and in the 1950 and           
    subsequent censuses, the question referred to attendance in the two         
    months preceding the census date.

    Until the 1910 census, there were no instructions limiting the kinds        
    of schools in which enrollment was to be counted. Starting in 1910,         
    the instructions indicated that attendance at "school, college, or          
    any educational institution" was to be counted. In 1930 an                  
    instruction to include "night school" was added.  In the 1940               
    instructions, night school, extension school, or vocational school          
    were included only if the school was part of the regular school             
    system.  Correspondence school work of any kind was excluded. In the        
    1950 instructions, the term "regular school" was introduced, and it         
    was defined as schooling which "advances a person towards an                
    elementary or high school diploma or a college, university, or              
    professional school degree." Vocational, trade, or business schools         
    were excluded unless they were graded and considered part of a              
    regular school system. On-the-job training was excluded as was              
    nursery school.  Instruction by correspondence was excluded unless it       
    was given by a regular school and counted towards promotion.                
                                                                                
                                                                                
    In 1960, the question used the term "regular school or college" and a       
    similar, though expanded, definition Of "regular" was included in the       
    instructions, which continued to exclude nursery school. Because of         
    the census' use of mailed questionnaires, the 1960 census was the           
    first in which instructions were written for the respondent as well         
    as enumerators. In the 1970 census, the questionnaire used the phrase       
    "regular school or college" and included instructions to "count             
    nursery school, kindergarten, and schooling which leads to an               
    elementary school certificate, high school diploma, or college              
    degree."  Instructions in a separate document specified that to be          
    counted as regular school, nursery school must include instruction as       
    an important and integral phase of its program, and continued the           
    exclusion of vocational, trade, and business schools. The 1980 census       
    question was very similar to the 1970 question, but the separate            
    instruction booklet did not require that nursery school include             
    substantial instructional content in order to be counted.                   
                                                                                
    The age range for which enrollment data have been obtained and              
    published has varied over the censuses. Information on enrollment was       
    recorded for persons of all ages in the 1930 and 1940 and 1970              
    through 1990. for persons under age 30, in 1950; and for persons age        
    5 to 34, in 1960. Most of the published enrollment figures referred         
    to persons age 5 to 20 in the 1930 census, 5 to 24 in 1940, 5 to 29         
    in 1950, 5 to 34 in 1960, 3 to 34 in 1970, and 3 years old and over         
    in 1980. This growth in the age group whose enrollment was reported         
    reflects increased interest in the number of children in preprimary         
    schools and in the number of older persons attending colleges and           
    universities.                                                               
                                                                                
    In the 1950 and subsequent censuses, college students were enumerated       
    where they lived while attending college, whereas in earlier                
    censuses, they generally were enumerated at their parental homes.           
    This change should not affect the comparability of national figures

    on college enrollment since 1940; however, it may affect the                
    comparability over time of enrollment figures at sub-national levels.       
                                                                                
    Type of school was first introduced in the 1960 census, where a             
    separate question asked the enrolled persons whether they were in a         
    "public" or "private" school. Since the 1970 census, the type of            
    school was incorporated into the response categories for the                
    enrollment question and the terms were changed to "public," "1              
    parochial," and "other private." In the 1980 census, "private, church       
    related and "private, riot church related" replaced "parochial" and         
    "other private."                                                            
                                                                                
    Grade of enrollment was first available in the 1940 census, where it        
    was obtained from responses to the question on highest grade of             
    school completed.  Enumerators were instructed that "for a person           
    still in school, the last grade completed will be the grade preceding       
    the one in which he or she was now enrolled." From 1950 to 1980,            
    grade of enrollment was obtained from the highest grade attended in         
    the two-part question used to measure educational attainment.  (For         
    more information, see the discussion under "Educational Attainment.")       
    The form of the question from which level of enrollment was derived         
    in the 1990 census most closely corresponds to the question used in         
    1940. While data from prior censuses can be aggregated to provide           
    levels of enrollment comparable to the 1990 census, 1990 data cannot        
    be disaggregated to show single grade of enrollment as in previous          
    censuses.                                                                   
                                                                                
    Data on school enrollment were also collected and published by other        
    Federal, State, and local government agencies. Where these data were        
    obtained from administrative records of school systems and                  
    institutions of higher learning they were only roughly comparable           
    with data from population censuses and household surveys because of         
    differences in definitions and concepts, subject matter covered, time       
    references, and enumeration methods, At the local level, the                
    difference between the location of the institution and the residence        
    of the student may affect the comparability of census and                   
    administrative data.  Differences between the boundaries of school          
    districts and census geographic units also may affect these                 
    comparisons.                                                                
                                                                                
    SELF-CARE LIMITATION STATUS                                                 
                                                                                
    The data on self-care limitation status were derived from answers to        
    questionnaire item 19b, which was asked of a sample of persons 15           
    years old and over. Persons were identified as having a self-care           
    limitation if they had a health condition that had lasted for 6 or          
    more months and which made it difficult to take care of their own           
    personal needs, such as dressing, bathing, or getting around inside         
    the home.                                                                   
                                                                                
    The term "health condition" referred to both physical and mental

    conditions. A temporary health problem, such as a broken bone that          
    was expected to heal normally, was not considered a health condition.       
                                                                                
    Comparability-This was the first time that a question on self-care          
    limitation was included in the census.                                      
                                                                                
    SEX                                                                         
                                                                                
    The data on sex were derived from answers to questionnaire item 3,          
    which was asked of all persons. For most cases in which sex was not         
    reported, it was determined by the appropriate entry from the               
    person's given name and household relationship. Otherwise, sex was          
    imputed according to the relationship to the householder and the age        
    and marital status of the person.                                           
                                                                                
    Sex Ratio-A measure derived by dividing the total number of males by        
    the total number of females and multiplying by 100.                         
                                                                                
    Comparability-A question on the sex of individuals was asked of the         
    total population in every census.                                           
                                                                                
    VETERAN STATUS                                                              
                                                                                
    Data on veteran status, period of military service, and years of            
    military service were derived from answers to questionnaire item 17,        
    which was asked of a sample of persons.                                     
                                                                                
    Veteran Status-The data on veteran status were derived from responses       
    to question 17a. For census data products, a "civilian veteran" is a        
    person 16 years old or over who had served (even for a short time)          
    but is not now serving on active duty in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air           
    Force, Marine Corps, or the Coast Guard, or who served as a Merchant        
    Marine seaman during World War II. Persons who served in the National       
    Guard or military Reserves are classified as veterans only if they          
    were ever called or ordered to active duty not counting the 4-6             
    months for initial training or yearly summer camps. All other               
    civilians 16 years old and over are classified as nonveterans.              
                                                                                
    Period of Military Service-Persons who indicated in question 17a that       
    they had served on active duty (civilian veterans) or were now on           
    active duty were asked to indicate in question 17b the period or            
    periods in which they served. Persons serving in at least one wartime       
    period are classified in their most recent wartime period. For              
    example, persons who served both during the Korean conflict and the         
    post-Korean peacetime era between February 1955 and July 1964 are           
    classified in one of the two "Korean conflict" categories. If the           
    same person had also served during the Vietnam era, he or she would         
    instead be included in the "Vietnam era and Korean conflict"                
    category. The responses were edited to eliminate inconsistencies            
    between reported period(s) of service and the age of the person and         
    to cancel out reported combinations of periods containing

    unreasonable gaps (for example, a person could not serve during World       
    War I and the Korean conflict without serving during World War II).         
    Note that the period of service categories shown in this report are         
    mutually exclusive.                                                         
                                                                                
    Years of Military Service-Persons who indicated in question 17a that        
    they had served on active duty (civilian veterans) or were now on           
    active duty were asked to report the total number of years of               
    active-duty service in question 17c. The data were edited for               
    consistency with responses to question 17b (Period of Military              
    Service) and with the age of the person.                                    
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data-There may be a tendency for the following            
    kinds of persons to report erroneously that they served on active           
    duty in the Armed Forces: (a) persons who served in the National            
    Guard or military Reserves but were never called to active duty; (b)        
    civilian employees or volunteers for the USO, Red Cross, or the             
    Department of Defense (or its predecessor Departments, War and Navy);       
    and (c) employees of the Merchant Marine or Public Health Service.          
    There may also be a tendency for persons to erroneously round up            
    months to the nearest year in question 17c (for example, persons with       
    1 year 8 months of active duty military service may mistakenly report       
    "2 years").                                                                 
                                                                                
    Comparability-Since census data on veterans were based on                   
    self-reported responses, they may differ from data from other sources       
    such as administrative records of the Department of Defense. Census         
    data may also differ from Veterans Administration data on the               
    benefits eligible population, since factors determining eligibility         
    for veterans benefits differ from the rules for classifying veterans        
    in the census.                                                              
                                                                                
    The wording of the question on veteran status (17a) for 1990 was            
    expanded from the veteran/not veteran question in 1980 to include           
    questions on current active duty status and service in the military         
    Reserves and the National Guard.  The expansion was intended to             
    clarify the appropriate response for persons in the Armed Forces and        
    for persons who served in the National Guard or military Reserve            
    units only. For the first time in a census, service during World War        
    II as a Merchant Marine Seaman was considered active-duty military          
    service and persons with such service were counted as veterans. An          
    additional period of military service, "September 1980 or later" was        
    added in 1990. As in 1970 and 1980, persons reporting more than one         
    period of service are shown in the most recent wartime period of            
    service category. Question 17c (Years of Military Service) was new          
    for 1990.                                                                   
                                                                                
    WORK DISABILITY STATUS                                                      
                                                                                
    The data on work disability were derived from answers to                    
    questionnaire item 18, which was asked of a sample of persons 15            
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      Page 244                                          ICPSR 9952              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    years old and over. Persons were identified as having a work                
    disability if they had a health condition that had lasted for 6 or          
    more months and which limited the kind or amount of work they could         
    do at a job or business. A person was limited in the kind of work he        
    or she could do if the person had a health condition which restricted       
    his or her choice of jobs. A person was limited in the amount of work       
    if he or she was not able to work full-time. Persons with a work            
    disability were further classified as "Prevented from working" or           
    "Not prevented from working."                                               
                                                                                
    The term "health condition" referred to both physical and mental            
    conditions. A temporary health problem, such as a broken bone that          
    was expected to heal normally, was not considered a health condition.       
                                                                                
    Comparability-The wording of the question on work disability was the        
    same in 1990 as in 1980. Information on work disability was first           
    collected in 1970. In that census, the work disability question did         
    not contain a clause restricting the definition of disability to            
    limitations caused by a health condition that had lasted 6 or more          
    months; however, it did contain a separate question about the               
    duration of the disability.                                                 
                                                                                
    WORK STATUS IN 1989                                                         
                                                                                
    The data on work status in 1989 were derived from answers to                
    questionnaire item 31, which was asked of a sample of persons.              
    Persons 16 years old and over who worked 1 or more weeks according to       
    the criteria described below are classified as "Worked in 1989." All        
    other persons 16 years old and over are classified as "Did not work         
    in 1989." Some tabulations showing work status in 1989 include 15           
    year olds; these persons, by definition, are classified as "Did not         
    work in 1989." Weeks Worked in 1989                                         
                                                                                
    The data on weeks worked in 1989 were derived from responses to             
    questionnaire item 31b. Question 31b (Weeks Worked in 1989) was asked       
    of persons 16 years old and over who indicated in question 31a that         
    they worked in 1989.                                                        
                                                                                
    The data pertain to the number of weeks during 1989 in which a person       
    did any work for pay or profit (including paid vacation and paid sick       
    leave) or worked without pay on a family farm or in a family                
    business. Weeks of active service in the Armed Forces are also              
    included.                                                                   
                                                                                
    Usual Hours Worked Per Week Worked in 1989                                  
                                                                                
    The data on usual hours worked per week worked in 1989 were derived         
    from answers to questionnaire item 31c. This question was asked of          
    persons 16 years old and over who indicated that they worked in 1989.       
                                                                                
    The data pertain to the number of hours a person usually worked             
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      ICPSR 9952                                          Page 245              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    during the weeks worked in 1989. The respondent was to report the           
    number of hours worked per week in the majority of the weeks he or          
    she worked in 1989. If the hours worked per week varied considerably        
    during 1989, the respondent was to report an approximate average of         
    the hours worked per week. The statistics on usual hours worked per         
    week in 1989 are not necessarily related to the data on actual hours        
    worked during the census reference week (question 21b).                     
                                                                                
    Persons 16 years old and over who reported that they usually worked         
    35 or more hours each week during the weeks they worked are                 
    classified as "Usually worked full time;" persons who reported that         
    they usually worked 1 to 34 hours are classified as "Usually worked         
    part time."                                                                 
                                                                                
    Year-Round Full-Time Workers-All persons 16 years old and over who          
    usually worked 35 hours or more per week for 50 to 52 weeks in 1989.        
                                                                                
    Number of Workers in Family in 1989-The term "worker" as used for           
    these data is defined based on the criteria for Work Status in 1989.        
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data-It is probable that the number of persons who        
    worked in 1989 and the number of weeks worked are understated since         
    there was some tendency for respondents to forget intermittent or           
    short periods of employment or to exclude weeks worked without pay.         
    There may also be a tendency for persons not to include, weeks of           
    paid vacation among their weeks worked; one result may be that the          
    census figures may understate the number of persons who worked "50 to       
    52 weeks."                                                                  
                                                                                
    Comparability-The data on weeks worked collected in the 1990 census         
    were comparable with data from the 1980,1970, and 1960 censuses, but        
    may not be entirely comparable with data from the 1940 and 1950             
    censuses. Since the 1960 census, two separate questions have been           
    used to obtain this information. The first identified persons with          
    any work experience during the year and, thus, indicated those              
    persons for whom the questions on number of weeks worked applied. In        
    1940 and 1950, however, the questionnaires contained only a single          
    question on number of weeks worked.                                         
                                                                                
    In 1970, persons responded to the question on weeks worked by               
    indicating one of six weeks-worked intervals. In 1980 and 1990,             
    persons were asked to enter the specific number of weeks they worked,       
                                                                                
    YEAR OF ENTRY                                                               
                                                                                
    The data on year of entry were derived from answers to questionnaire        
    item 10, which was asked of a sample of persons. The question, "When        
    did this person come to the United States to stay.?" was asked of           
    persons who indicated in the question on citizenship that they were         
    not born in the United States. (For more information, see the               
    discussion under "Citizenship.")

    The 1990 census questions, tabulations, and census data products            
    about citizenship and year of entry include no reference to                 
    immigration. All persons who were born and resided outside the United       
    States before becoming residents of the United States have a date of        
    entry. Some of these persons are U.S.  citizens by birth (e.g.,             
    persons born in Puerto Rico or born abroad of American parents). To         
    avoid any possible confusion concerning the date of entry of persons        
    who are U.S. citizens by birth, the term, "year of entry" is used in        
    this report instead of the term "year of immigration."                      
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data-The census questions on nativity, citizenship,       
    and year of entry were not designed to measure the degree of                
    permanence of residence in the United States. The phrase, "to stay"         
    was used to obtain the year in which the person became a resident of        
    the United States. Although the respondent was directed to indicate         
    the year he or she entered the country "to stay," it was difficult to       
    ensure that respondents interpreted the phrase correctly.                   
                                                                                
    Comparability-A question on year of entry, (alternately called "year        
    of immigration") was asked in each decennial census from 1890 to            
    1930, 1970, and 1980. In 1980, the question on year of entry included       
    six arrival time intervals. The number of arrival intervals was             
    expanded to ten in 1990. In 1980, the question on year of entry was         
    asked only of the foreign-born population. In 1990, all persons who         
    responded to the long-form questionnaire and were not born in the           
    United States were to complete the question on year of entry.               
                                                                                
    HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS LIVING QUARTERS                                     
                                                                                
    Living quarters are classified as either housing units or group             
    quarters. (For more information, see the discussion of "Group               
    Quarters" under Population Characteristics.) Usually, living quarters       
    are in structures intended for residential use (for example, a              
    one-family home, apartment house, hotel or motel, boarding house, or        
    mobile home). Living quarters also may be in structures intended for        
    nonresidential use (for example, the rooms in a warehouse where a           
    guard lives), as well as in places such as tents, vans, shelters for        
    the homeless, dormitories, barracks, and old railroad cars.                 
                                                                                
    Housing Units-A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home        
    or trailer, a group of rooms or a single room occupied as separate          
    living quarters or, if vacant, intended for occupancy as separate           
    living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the            
    occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the             
    building and which have direct access from outside the building or          
    through a common hall.                                                      
                                                                                
    The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or       
    more families living together, or any other group of related or             
    unrelated persons who share living arrangements. For vacant units,          
    the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to the

    intended occupants whenever possible. If that information cannot be         
    obtained, the criteria are applied to the previous occupants.               
                                                                                
    Both occupied and vacant housing units are included in the housing          
    unit inventory, except that recreational vehicles, boats, vans,             
    tents, railroad cars, and the like are included only if they are            
    occupied as someone's usual place of residence. Vacant mobile homes         
    are included provided they are intended for occupancy on the site           
    where they stand. Vacant mobile homes on dealers' sales lots, at the        
    factory, or in storage yards are excluded from the housing inventory.       
                                                                                
    If the living quarters contains nine or more persons unrelated to the       
    householder or person in charge (a total of at least 10 unrelated           
    persons), it is classified as group quarters. if the living quarters        
    contains eight or fewer persons unrelated to the householder or             
    person in charge, it is classified as a housing unit.                       
                                                                                
    Occupied Housing Units-A housing unit is classified as occupied if it       
    is the usual place of residence of the person or group of persons           
    living in it at the time of enumeration, or if the occupants are only       
    temporarily absent; that is, away on vacation or business. If all the       
    persons staying in the unit at the time of the census have their            
    usual place of residence elsewhere, the unit is classified as vacant.       
    A household includes all the persons who occupy a housing unit as           
    their usual place of residence. By definition, the count of occupied        
    housing units for 100-percent tabulations is the same as the count of       
    households or householders. In sample tabulations, the counts of            
    household and occupied housing units may vary slightly because of           
    different sample weighting methods.                                         
                                                                                
    Vacant Housing Units-A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in        
    it at the time of enumeration, unless its occupants are only                
    temporarily absent. Units temporarily occupied at the time of               
    enumeration entirely by persons who have a usual residence elsewhere        
    also are classified as vacant. (For more information, see discussion        
    under "Usual Home Elsewhere.")                                              
                                                                                
    New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if        
    construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and doors       
    are installed and final usable floors are in place. Vacant units are        
    excluded if they are open to the elements; that is, the roof, walls,        
    windows, and/or doors no longer protect the interior from the               
    elements, or if there is positive evidence (such as a sign on the           
    house or in the block) that the unit is condemned or is to be               
    demolished. Also excluded are quarters being used entirely for              
    nonresidential purposes, such as a store or an office, or quarters          
    used for the storage of business supplies or inventory, machinery, or       
    agricultural products.                                                      
                                                                                
    Hotels, Motels, Rooming Houses, Etc.-Occupied rooms or suites of            
    rooms in hotels, motels, and similar places are classified as housing

    units only when occupied by permanent residents; that is, persons who       
    consider the hotel as their usual place of residence or have no usual       
    place of residence elsewhere.  Vacant rooms or suites of rooms are          
    classified as housing units only in those hotels, motels, and similar       
    places in which 75 percent or more of the accommodations are occupied       
    by permanent residents.                                                     
                                                                                
    If any of the occupants in a rooming or boarding house live and eat         
    separately from others in the building and have direct access, their        
    quarters are classified as separate housing units.                          
                                                                                
    Staff Living Quarters-The living quarters occupied by staff personnel       
    within any group quarters are separate housing units if they satisfy        
    the housing unit criteria of separateness and direct access;                
    otherwise, they are considered group quarters.                              
                                                                                
    Comparability-The first Census of Housing in 1940 established the           
    "dwelling unit" concept. Although the term became"housing unit" and         
    the definition has been modified slightly in succeeding censuses, the       
    1990 definition is essentially comparable to previous censuses. There       
    was no change in the housing unit definition between 1980 and 1990.         
                                                                                
    ACREAGE                                                                     
                                                                                
    The data on acreage were obtained from questionnaire items H5a and H        
    19a.  Question H5a was asked at all occupied and vacant one-family          
    houses and mobile homes. Question H19a was asked on a sample basis at       
    occupied and vacant one-family houses and mobile homes.                     
                                                                                
    Question H5a asks whether the house or mobile home is located on a          
    place of 10 or more acres. The intent of this item is to exclude            
    owner-occupied and renter-occupied one-family houses on 10 or more          
    acres from the specified owner and reriter-occupied universes for           
    value and rent tabulations.                                                 
                                                                                
    Question H19a provides data on whether the unit is located on less          
    than 1 acre, The main purpose of this item, in conjunction with             
    question H19b on agricultural sales, is to identify farm units. (For        
    more information, see discussion under "Farm Residence.")                   
                                                                                
    For both items, the land may consist of more than one tract or plot.        
    These tracts or plots are usually adjoining; however, they may be           
    separated by a road, creek, another piece of land, etc.                     
                                                                                
    Comparability-Question H5a is similar to that asked in 1970 and 1980.       
    This item was asked for the first time of mobile home occupants in          
    1990. Question H19a is an abbreviated form of a question asked on a         
    sample basis in 1980. In previous censuses, information on city or          
    suburban lot and number of acres was obtained also.

    Data on the sales of agricultural crops were obtained from                  
    questionnaire item H19b, which was asked on a sample basis at               
    occupied one-family houses and mobile homes located on lots of 1 acre       
    or more. Data for this item exclude units on lots of less than 1            
    acre, units located in structures containing 2 or more units, and all       
    vacant units. This item refers to the total amount (before taxes and        
    expenses) received in 1989 from the sale of crops, vegetables,              
    fruits, nuts, livestock and livestock products, and nursery and             
    forest products, produced on "this property." Respondents new to a          
    unit were asked to estimate total agricultural sales in 1989 even if        
    some portion of the sales had been made by other occupants of the           
    unit.                                                                       
                                                                                
    This item is used mainly to classify housing units as farm or nonfarm       
    residences, not to provide detailed information on the sale of              
    agricultural products. Detailed information on the sale of                  
    agricultural products is provided by the Census Bureau's Census of          
    Agriculture (Fact finder for the Nation: Agricultural Statistics,           
    Bureau of the Census, 1989). (For more information, see the                 
    discussion under "Farm Residence.")

    The data on bedrooms were obtained from questionnaire item H9, which        
    was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. This item was          
    asked on a sample basis. The number of bedrooms is the count of rooms       
    designed to be used as bedrooms; that is, the number of rooms that          
    would be listed as bedrooms if the house or apartment were on the           
    market for sale or for rent. Included are all rooms intended to be          
    used as bedrooms even if they currently are being used for some other       
    purpose. A housing unit consisting of only one room, such as a              
    one-room efficiency apartment, is classified, by definition, as             
    having no bedroom.                                                          
                                                                                
    Comparability-Data on bedrooms have been collected in every census          
    since 1960.  In 1970 and 1980, data for bedrooms were shown only for        
    year-round units. In past censuses, a room was defined as a bedroom         
    if it was used mainly for sleeping even if also used for other              
    purposes. Rooms that were designed to be used as bedrooms but used          
    mainly for other purposes were not considered to be bedrooms. A             
    distribution of housing units by number of bedrooms calculated from         
    data collected in a 1986 test showed virtually no differences in the        
    two versions except in the two bedroom category, where the previous         
    "use" definition showed a slightly lower proportion of units.

    Boarded-up status was obtained from questionnaire item C2 and was           
    determined for all vacant units. Boarded-up units have windows and          
    doors covered by wood, metal, or masonry to protect the interior and        
    to prevent entry into the building A single-unit structure, a unit in

    a multi-unit structure, or an entire multi-unit structure may be            
    boarded-up in this way. For certain census data products, boarded-up        
    units are shown only for units in the "Other vacant" category. A unit       
    classified as "Usual home elsewhere" can never be boarded up.  (For         
    more information, see the discussion under "Usual Home Elsewhere.")         
                                                                                
    Comparability-This item was first asked in the 1980 census and was          
    shown only for year-round vacant housing units. In 1990, data are           
    shown for all vacant housing units.

    The data for business on property were obtained from questionnaire          
    item H5b, which was asked at all occupied and vacant one-family             
    houses and mobile homes.  This question is used to exclude                  
    owner-occupied one-family houses with business or medical offices on        
    the property from certain statistics on financial characteristics.          
                                                                                
    A business must be easily recognizable from the outside. It usually         
    will have a separate outside entrance and have the appearance of a          
    business, such as a grocery store, restaurant, or barber shop, It may       
    either attached to the house or mobile home or located elsewhere on         
    the property. Those housing units in which a room is used for               
    business or professional purposes and have no recognizable                  
    alterations to the outside are not considered as having a business.         
    Medical offices are considered businesses for tabulation purposes.          
                                                                                
    Comparability-Data on business on property have been collected since        
    1940.                                                                       
                                                                                
    CONDOMINIUM FEE                                                             
                                                                                
    The data on condominium fee were obtained from questionnaire item           
    H25, which was asked at owner-occupied condominiums, This item was          
    asked on a sample basis. A condominium fee normally is charged              
    monthly to the owners of the individual condominium units by the            
    condominium owners association to cover operating, maintenance,             
    administrative, and improvement costs of the common property                
    (grounds, halls, lobby, parking areas, laundry rooms, swimming pool,        
    etc.) The costs for utilities and or fuels may be included in the           
    condominium fee if the units do not have separate meters.                   
                                                                                
    Data on condominium fees may include real estate tax and/or insurance       
    payments for the common property, but do not include real estate            
    taxes or fire, hazard, and flood insurance for the individual unit          
    already reported in questions H21 and H22.                                  
                                                                                
    Amounts reported were the regular monthly payment, even if paid by          
    someone outside the household or remain unpaid. Costs were estimated        
    as closely as possible when exact costs were not known.

    The data from this item were added to payments for mortgages (both          
    first and junior mortgages and home equity loans); real estate taxes;       
    fire, hazard and flood insurance payments; and utilities and fuels to       
    derive "Selected Monthly Owner Costs" and "Selected Monthly Owner           
    Costs as a Percentage of Household Income in 1989" for condominium          
    owners. Comparability-This is a new item in 1990.                           
                                                                                
    CONDOMINIUM STATUS                                                          
                                                                                
    The data on condominium housing units were obtained from                    
    questionnaire item H18, which was asked on a sample basis at both           
    occupied and vacant housing units. Condominium is a type of ownership       
    that enables a person to own an apartment or house in a development         
    of similarly owned units and to hold a common or joint ownership in         
    some or all of the common areas and facilities such as land, roof,          
    hallways, entrances, elevators, swimming pool, etc.  Condominiums may       
    be single-family houses as well as units in apartment buildings. A          
    condominium unit need not be occupied by the owner to be counted as         
    such. A unit classified as "mobile home or trailer" or "other" (see         
    discussion under "Units in Structure") cannot be a condominium unit.        
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data-Testing done prior to the 1980 and 1990              
    censuses indicated that the number of condominiums may be slightly          
    overstated.                                                                 
                                                                                
    Comparability-In 1970, condominiums were grouped together with              
    cooperative housing units, and the data were reported only for              
    owner-occupied cooperatives and condominiums. Beginning in 1980, the        
    census identified all condominium units and the data were shown for         
    renter-occupied and vacant year-round condominiums as well as owner         
    occupied. In 1970 and 1980, the question on condominiums was asked on       
    a 100-percent basis. In 1990, it was asked on a sample basis.               
                                                                                
    CONTRACT RENT                                                               
                                                                                
    The data on contract rent (also referred to as "rent asked" for             
    vacant units) were obtained from questionnaire item H7a, which was          
    asked at all occupied housing units that were rented for cash rent          
    and all vacant housing units that were for rent at the time of              
    enumeration.                                                                
                                                                                
    Housing units that are renter occupied without pay merit of cash rent       
    are shown separately as "No cash rent" in census data products. The         
    unit may be owned by friends or relatives who live elsewhere and who        
    allow occupancy without charge.  Rent-free houses or apartments may         
    be provided to compensate caretakers, ministers, tenant farmers,            
    sharecroppers, or others.                                                   
                                                                                
    Contract rent is the monthly rent agreed to or contracted for,              
    regardless of any furnishings, utilities, fees, meals, or services          
    that may be included. For vacant units, it is the monthly rent asked

    for the rental unit at the time of enumeration.                             
                                                                                
    If the contract rent includes rent for a business unit or for living        
    quarters occupied by another household, the respondent was instructed       
    to report that part of the rent estimated to be for his or her unit         
    only. Respondents were asked to report rent only for the housing unit       
    enumerated and to exclude any rent paid for additional units or for         
    business premises.                                                          
                                                                                
    If a renter pays rent to the owner of a condominium or cooperative,         
    and the condominium fee or cooperative carrying charge is also paid         
    by the renter to the owner, the respondent was instructed to include        
    the fee or carrying charge.                                                 
                                                                                
    If a renter receives payments from lodgers or roomers who are listed        
    as members of the household, the respondent was instructed to report        
    the rent without deduction for any payments received from the lodgers       
    or roomers. The respondent was instructed to report the rent agreed         
    to or contracted f or even if paid by someone else such as friends or       
    relatives living elsewhere, or a church or welfare agency.                  
                                                                                
    In some tabulations, contract rent is presented for all                     
    renter-occupied housing units, as well as specified renter-occupied         
    and vacant-for-rent units.  Specified renter-occupied and specified         
    vacant-for-rent units exclude one-family houses on 10 or more acres.        
    (For more information on rent, see the discussion under "Gross              
    Rent.")                                                                     
                                                                                
    Median and Quartile Contract Rent-The median divides the rent               
    distribution into two equal parts. Quartiles divide the rent                
    distribution into four equal parts. In computing median and quartile        
    contract rent, units reported as "No cash rent" are excluded. Median        
    and quartile rent calculations are rounded to the nearest whole             
    dollar. (For more information on medians and quartiles, see the             
    discussion under "Derived Measures.")                                       
                                                                                
    Aggregate Contract Rent-To calculate aggregate contract rent, the           
    amount assigned for the category "Less than $80" is $50. The amount         
    assigned to the category "$1,000 or more" is $1,250. Mean contract          
    rent is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. (For more information on       
    aggregates and means, see the discussion under "Derived Measures.")         
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data-In the 1970 and 1980 censuses, contract rent         
    for vacant units had high allocation rates, about 35 percent.               
                                                                                
    Comparability-Data on this item have been collected since 1930. For         
    1990, quartiles were added because the range of rents and values in         
    the United States has increased in recent years. Upper and lower            
    quartiles can be used to note large rent and value differences among        
    various geographic areas.

    DURATION OF VACANCY                                                         
                                                                                
    The data for duration of vacancy (also referred to as "months               
    vacant") were obtained from questionnaire item D, which was completed       
    by census enumerators.  The statistics on duration of vacancy refer         
    to the length of time (in months and years) between the date the last       
    occupants moved from the unit and the time of enumeration. The data,        
    therefore, do not provide a direct measure of the total length of           
    time units remain vacant.                                                   
                                                                                
    For newly constructed units which have never been occupied, the             
    duration of vacancy is counted from the date construction was               
    completed. For recently converted or merged units, the time is              
    reported from the date conversion or merger was completed. Units            
    occupied by an entire household with a usual home elsewhere are             
    assigned to the "Less than 1 month" interval.                               
                                                                                
    Comparability-Similar data have been collected since 1960. In 1970          
    and 1980, these data were shown only for year-round vacant housing          
    units. In 1990, these data are shown for all vacant housing units.          
                                                                                
    FARM RESIDENCE                                                              
                                                                                
    The data on farm residence were obtained from questionnaire items           
    H19a and H19b. An occupied one family house or mobile home is               
    classlied as a farm residence if: (1) the housing unit is located on        
    a property of 1 acre or more, and (2) at least $1,000 worth of              
    agricultural products were sold from the property in 1989. Group            
    quarters and housing units that are in multi-unit buildings or vacant       
    are not included as farm residences.                                        
                                                                                
    A one family unit occupied by a tenant household paying cash rent for       
    land and buildings is enumerated as a farm residence only if sales of       
    agricultural products from units yard (as opposed to the general            
    property on which it is located) amounted to at least $1,000 in 1989.       
    A one-family unit occupied by a tenant household that does not pay          
    cash rent is enumerated as a farm residence if the remainder of the         
    farm (including its yard) qualifies as a farm.                              
                                                                                
    Farm residence is provided as an independent data item only for             
    housing units located in rural areas. It may be derived for housing         
    units in urban areas from the data items on acreage and sales of            
    agricultural products on the public-use microdata sample (PUMS)             
    files. (For more information on PUMS, see Appendix F, Data Products         
    and User Assistance.)                                                       
                                                                                
    The farm population consists of persons in households living in farm        
    residences. Some persons who are counted on a property classified as        
    a farm (including in some cases farm workers) are excluded from the         
    farm population.  Such per-sons include those who reside in                 
    multi-unit buildings or group quarters.

    Comparability-These are the same criteria that were used to define a        
    farm residence in 1980. In 1960 and 1970, a farm was defined as a           
    place of 10 or more acres with at least $50 worth of agricultural           
    sales or a place of less than 10 acres with at least $250 worth of          
    agricultural sales. Earlier censuses used other definitions. Note           
    that the definition of a farm residence differs from the definition         
    of a farm in the Census of Agriculture (Fact finder for the Nation:         
    Agricultural Statistics, Bureau of the Census, 1989).                       
                                                                                
    GROSS RENT                                                                  
                                                                                
    Gross rent is the contract rent plus the estimated average monthly          
    cost of utilities (electricity, gas, and water) and fuels (oil, coal,       
    kerosene, wood, etc.) if these are paid for by the renter (or paid          
    for the renter by someone else). Gross rent is intended to eliminate        
    differentials which result from varying practices with respect to the       
    inclusion of utilities and fuels as part of the rental payment. The         
    estimated costs of utilities ana fuels are reported on a yearly basis       
    but are converted to monthly figures for the tabulations.  Renter           
    units occupied without payment of cash rent are shown separately as         
    "No cash rent" in the tabulations. Gross rent is calculated on a            
    sample basis.  Comparability-Data on gross rent have been collected         
    since 1940 for renter-occupied housing units. In 1980, costs for            
    electricity and gas were collected as average monthly costs. In 1990,       
    all utility and fuel costs were collected as yearly costs and divided       
    by 12 to provide an average monthly cost.                                   
                                                                                
    GROSS RENT AS A PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN 1989                      
                                                                                
    Gross rent as a percentage of household income in 1989 is a computed        
    ratio of monthly gross rent to monthly household income (total              
    household income in 1989 divided by 12). The ratio was computed             
    separately for each unit and was rounded to the nearest whole               
    percentage. Units for which no cash rent is paid and units occupied         
    by households that reported no income or a net loss in 1989 comprise        
    the category "Not computed." This item is calculated on a sample            
    basis.

    The data on house heating fuel were obtained from questionnaire item        
    H14, which was asked at occupied housing units. This item was asked         
    on a sample basis. The data show the type of fuel used most to heat         
    the house or apartment.

    questionnaire item H22, which was asked at a sample of owner-occupied       
    one-family houses, condominiums, and mobile homes. The statistics for       
    this item refer to the annual premium for fire, hazard, and flood           
    insurance on the property (land and buildings); that is, policies           
    that protect the property and its contents against loss due to damage       
    by fire, lightning, winds, hail, flood, explosion, and so on.               
                                                                                
    Liability policies are included only if they are paid with the fire,        
    hazard, and flood insurance premiums and the amounts for fire,              
    hazard, and flood cannot be separated. Premiums are included even if        
    paid by someone outside the household or remain unpaid. When premiums       
    are paid on other than a yearly basis, the premiums are converted to        
    a yearly basis.                                                             
                                                                                
    The payment for fire, hazard, and flood insurance is added to               
    payments for real estate taxes, utilities, fuels, and mortgages (both       
    first and junior mortgages and home equity loans) to derive "Selected       
    Monthly Owner Costs" and "Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a                 
    Percentage of Household Income in 1989."                                    
                                                                                
    A separate question (H23d determines whether insurance premiums are         
    included in the mortgage payment to the lender(s). This makes it            
    possible to avoid counting these premiums twice in the computations.        
                                                                                
    Comparability-Data on payment for fire and hazard insurance were            
    collected for the first time in 1980. Flood insurance was not               
    specifically mentioned in the wording of the question in 1980. The          
    question was asked only at owner-occupied one-family houses. Excluded       
    were mobile homes, condominiums, houses with a business or medical          
    off ice on the property, houses on 10 or more acres, and housing            
    units in multi-unit buildings. In 1990, the question was asked of all

    one-famity owner-occupied houses, including houses on 10 or more            
    acres. It also was asked at mobile homes, condominiums, and one family      
    houses with a business or medical office on the property.                   
                                                                                
    KITCHEN FACILITIES                                                          
                                                                                
    Data on kitchen facilities were obtained from questionnaire item H11,       
    which was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. A unit has       
    complete kitchen facilities when it has all of the following: (1) an        
    installed sink with piped water, (2) a range, cook top and convection       
    or microwave oven, or cookstove, and (3) a refrigerator. All kitchen        
    facilities must be located in the structure. They need not be in the        
    same room. Portable cooking equipment is not considered a range or          
    cookstove. An ice box is not considered to be a refrigerator.               
                                                                                
    Comparability-Data on complete kitchen facilities were collected for        
    the first time in 1970. Earlier censuses collected data on individual       
    components, such as kitchen sink and type of refrigeration equipment.       
    In 1970 and 1980, data for kitchen facilities were shown only for           
    year-round units. In 1990, data are shown for all housing units.            
                                                                                
    MEALS INCLUDED IN RENT                                                      
                                                                                
    The data on meals included in the rent were obtained from                   
    questionnaire item H7b, which was asked of all occupied housing units       
    that were rented for cash and all vacant housing units that were for        
    rent at the time of enumeration.                                            
                                                                                
    The statistics on meals included in rent are presented for specified        
    renter-occupied and specified vacant-for-rent units. Specified              
    renter-occupied and specified vacant-for-rent units exclude one-family      
    houses on 10 or more acres. (For more information, see the discussion       
    under "Contract Rent.")                                                     
                                                                                
    Comparabilty-This is a new item in 1990. It is intended to measure          
    "congregate" housing, which generally is considered to be housing           
    units where the rent includes meals and other services, such as             
    transportation to shopping and recreation.                                  
                                                                                
    MOBILE HOME COSTS                                                           
                                                                                
    The data on mobile home costs were obtained from questionnaire item         
    H26, which was asked at owner-occupied mobile homes. This item was          
    asked on a sample basis.                                                    
                                                                                
    These data include the total yearly costs for personal property             
    taxes, land or site rent, registration fees, and license fees on all        
    owner-occupied mobile homes. The instructions are to not include real       
    estate taxes already reported in question H21.                              
                                                                                
    Costs are estimated as closely as possible when exact costs are not

    known.  Amounts are the total for an entire 12-month billing period,        
    even if they are paid by someone outside the household or remain            
    unpaid.                                                                     
                                                                                
    The data from this item are added to payments for mortgages, real           
    estate taxes, fire, hazard, and flood insurance payments, Utilities,        
    and fuels to derive selected monthly owner costs for mobile homes           
    owners.                                                                     
                                                                                
    Comparability-This item is new for 1990.                                    
                                                                                
    MORTGAGE PAYMENT                                                            
                                                                                
    The data on mortgage payment were obtained from questionnaire item          
    H23b, which was asked at owner-occupied one-family houses,                  
    condominiums, and mobile homes.  This item was asked on a sample            
    basis. Question H23b provides the regular monthly amount required to        
    be paid the lender for the first mortgage (deed of trust, contract to       
    purchase, or similar debt) on the property. Amounts are included even       
    if the payments are delinquent or paid by someone else. The amounts         
    reported are included in the computation of "Selected Monthly Owner         
    Costs" and "Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household       
    Income in 1989" for units with a mortgage.                                  
                                                                                
    The amounts reported include everything paid to the lender including        
    principal and interest payments, real estate taxes, fire, hazard, and       
    flood insurance payments, and mortgage insurance premiums. Separate         
    questions determine whether real estate taxes and fire, hazard, and         
    flood insurance payments are included in the mortgage payment to the        
    lender. This makes it possible to avoid counting these components           
    twice in the computation of "Selected Monthly Owner Costs."                 
                                                                                
    Comparability-Information on mortgage payment was collected for the         
    first time in 1980. It was collected only at owner-occupied                 
    one-family houses. Excluded were mobile homes, condominiums, houses         
    with a business or medical off ice on the property, one-family houses       
    on 10 or more acres, and housing units in multi-unit buildings. In          
    1990, the questions on monthly mortgage payments were asked of all          
    owner-occupied one-family houses, including one-family houses on 10         
    or more acres. They were also asked at mobile homes, condominiums,          
    and one-family houses with a business or medical office.                    
                                                                                
    The 1980 census obtained total regular monthly mortgage payments,           
    including payments on second or junior mortgages, from a single             
    question. Two questions were used in 1990; one for regular monthly          
    payments on first mortgages, and one for regular monthly payments on        
    second or junior mortgages or home equity loans. (For more                  
    information, see the discussion under "Second or Junior Mortgage            
    Payment.")

    The data on mortgage status were obtained from questionnaire items          
    H23a and H24a, which were asked at owner-occupied one-family houses,        
    condominiums, and mobile homes. "Mortgage" refers to all forms of           
    debt where the property is pledged as security for repayment of the         
    debt. It includes such debt instruments as deeds of trust, trust            
    deeds, contracts to purchase, land contracts, junior mortgages and          
    home equity loans.                                                          
                                                                                
    A mortgage is considered a first mortgage if it has prior claim over        
    any other mortgage or if it is the only mortgage on the property. All       
    other mortgages, (second, third, etc.) are considered junior                
    mortgages. A home equity loan is generally a junior mortgage. If no         
    first mortgage is reported, but a junior mortgage or home equity loan       
    is reported, then the loan is considered a first mortgage.                  
                                                                                
    In most census data products, the tabulations for "Selected Monthly         
    Owner Costs" and "Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of           
    Household Income in 1989" usually are shown separately for units            
    "with a mortgage" and for units owned free and clear of debt.               
                                                                                
    Comparability-A question on mortgage status was included in the 1940        
    and 1950 censuses, but not in the 1960 and 1970 censuses. The item          
    was reinstated in 1980 along with a separate question dealing with          
    the existence of second or junior mortgages. In 1980, the mortgage          
    status questions were asked at owner-occupied one-family houses on          
    less than 10 acres. Excluded were mobile homes, condominiums, houses        
    with a business or medical off ice, houses on 10 or more acres, and         
    housing units in multi-unit buildings. In 1990, the questions were          
    asked of all one-family owner-occupied housing units, including             
    houses on 10 or more acres. They were also asked at mobile homes,           
    condominiums, and houses with a business or medical office.                 
                                                                                
    PERSONS IN UNIT                                                             
                                                                                
    This item is based on the 100-percent count of persons in occupied          
    housing units. All persons occupying the housing unit are counted,          
    including the householder, occupants related to the householder, and        
    lodgers, roomers, boarders, and so forth.                                   
                                                                                
    The data on "persons in unit" show the number of housing units              
    occupied by the specified number of persons. The phrase "persons in         
    unit" is used for housing tabulations, "persons in households" for          
    population items. Figures for "persons in unit" match those for             
    "persons in household" for 100-percent data products. In sample             
    products, they may differ because of the weighting process.                 
                                                                                
    Median Persons in Unit-In computing median persons in unit, a whole         
    number is used as the midpoint of an interval; thus, a unit with 4          
    persons is treated as an interval ranging from 3.5 to 4.5 persons.          
    Median persons is rounded to the nearest hundredth. (For more               
    information on medians, see the discussion under "Derived Measures.")

    Persons in Occupied Housing Units-This is the total population minus        
    those persons living in group quarters. "Persons per occupied housing       
    unit" is computed by dividing the population living in housing units        
    by the number of occupied housing units.                                    
                                                                                
    PERSONS PER ROOM                                                            
                                                                                
    "Persons per room" is obtained by dividing the number of persons in         
    each occupied housing unit by the number of rooms in the unit.              
    Persons per room is rounded to the nearest hundredth. The figures           
    shown refer, therefore, to the number of occupied housing units             
    having the specified ratio of persons per room.                             
                                                                                
    Mean Persons Per Room-This is computed by dividing persons in housing       
    units by the aggregate number of rooms. This is intended to provide a       
    measure of utilization. A higher mean may indicate a greater degree         
    of utilization or crowding; a low mean may indicate underutilization.       
    (For more information on means, see the discussion under "Derived           
    Measures.")                                                                 
                                                                                
    PLUMBING FACILITIES                                                         
                                                                                
    The data on plumbing facilities were obtained from questionnaire item       
    H10, which was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. This        
    item was asked on a sample basis. Complete plumbing facilities              
    include hot and cold piped water, a flush toilet, and a bathtub or          
    shower. All three facilities must be located inside the house,              
    apartment, or mobile home, but not necessarily in the same room.            
    Housing units are classified as lacking complete plumbing facilities        
    when any of the three facilities are not present.                           
                                                                                
    Comparability-The 1990 data on complete plumbing facilities are not         
    strictly comparable with the 1980 data. In 1980, complete plumbing          
    facilities were defined as hot and cold piped water, a bathtub or           
    shower, and a flush toilet in the housing unit for the exclusive use        
    of the residents of that unit. In 1990, the Census Bureau dropped the       
    requirement of exclusive use from the definition of complete plumbing       
    facilities. Of the 2.3 million year-round housing units classified in       
    1980 as lacking complete plumbing for exclusive use, approximately          
    25 percent of these units had complete plumbing but the facilities          
    were also used by members of another household. From 1940 to 1970,          
    separate and more detailed questions were asked on piped water,             
    bathing, and toilet facilities.  In 1970 and 1980, the data on              
    plumbing facilities were shown only for year-round units.                   
                                                                                
    POVERTY STATUS OF HOUSEHOLDS IN 1989                                        
                                                                                
    The data on poverty status of households were derived from answers to       
    the income questions. The income items were asked on a sample basis.        
    Households are classified below the poverty level when the total 1989       
    income of the family or of the nonfamily householder is below the

    appropriate poverty threshold. The income of persons living in the          
    household who are unrelated to the householder is not considered when       
    determining the poverty status of a household, nor does their               
    presence affect the household size in determining the appropriate           
    poverty threshold. The poverty thresholds vary depending upon three         
    criteria: size of family, number of children, and age of the family         
    householder or unrelated individual for one and two-persons                 
    households. (For more information, see the discussion Of "Poverty           
    Status in 1989" and "Income in 1989" under Population                       
    Characteristics.)                                                           
                                                                                
    REAL ESTATE TAXES                                                           
                                                                                
    The data on real estate taxes were obtained from questionnaire item         
    H21, which was asked at owner-occupied one-family houses,                   
    condominiums, and mobile homes.  The statistics from this question          
    refer to the total amount of all real estate taxes on the entire            
    property (land and buildings) payable in 1989 to all taxing                 
    jurisdictions, including special assessments, school taxes, county          
    taxes, and so forth.                                                        
                                                                                
    Real estate taxes include State, local, and all other real estate           
    taxes even if delinquent, unpaid, or paid by someone who is not a           
    member of the household.  However, taxes due from prior years are not       
    included. If taxes are paid on other than a yearly basis, the               
    payments are converted to a yearly basis.                                   
                                                                                
    The payment for real estate taxes is added to payments for fire,            
    hazard, and flood insurance; utilities and fuels; and mortgages (both       
    first and junior mortgages and home equity loans) to derive "Selected       
    Monthly Owner Costs" and "Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a                 
    Percentage of Household Income in 1989." A separate question (H23c)         
    determines whether real estate taxes are included in the mortgage           
    payment to the lender(s). This makes it possible to avoid counting          
    taxes twice in the computations.                                            
                                                                                
    Comparability-Data for real estate taxes were collected for the first       
    time in 1980. The question was asked only at owner-occupied                 
    one-family houses. Excluded were mobile homes or trailers,                  
    condominiums, houses with a business or medical office on the               
    property, houses on 10 or more acres, and housing units in multiunit        
    buildings. In 1990, the question was asked of all one-family                
    owner-occupied houses, including houses on 10 or more acres, It also        
    was asked at mobile homes, condominiums, and one-family houses with a       
    business or medical office on the property.                                 
                                                                                
    ROOMS                                                                       
                                                                                
    The data on rooms were obtained from questionnaire item H3, which was       
    asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. The statistics on          
    rooms are in terms of the number of housing units with a specified          
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      ICPSR 9952                                          Page 261              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    number of rooms. The intent of this question is to count the number         
    of whole rooms used for living purposes.                                    
                                                                                
    For each unit; rooms include living rooms, dining rooms, kitchens,          
    bedrooms, finished recreation rooms, enclosed porches suitable for          
    year-round use, and lodger's rooms. Excluded are strip or pullman           
    kitchens, bathrooms, open porches, balconies, halls or foyers,              
    half-rooms, utility rooms, unfinished attics or basements, or other         
    unfinished space used for storage. A partially divided room is a            
    separate room only if there is a partition from floor to ceiling, but       
    not if the partition consists solely of shelves or cabinets.                
                                                                                
    Median Rooms-This measure divides the room distribution into two            
    equal parts, one-half of the cases falling below the median number of       
    rooms and one-half above the median. In computing median rooms, the         
    whole number is used as the midpoint of the interval; thus, the             
    category "3 rooms" is treated as an interval ranging from 2.5 to 3.5        
    rooms. Median rooms is rounded to the nearest tenth. (For more              
    information on medians see the discussion under "Derived Measures.")        
                                                                                
    Aggregate Rooms-To calculate aggregate rooms, an arbitrary value of         
    "10" is assigned to rooms for units failing within the terminal             
    category, "9 or more."  (For more information on aggregates and             
    means, see the discussion under "Derived Measures.")                        
                                                                                
    Comparability-Data on rooms have been collected since 1940. In 1970         
    and 1980, these data were shown only for year-round housing units. In       
    1990, these data are shown for all housing units.                           
                                                                                
    SECOND OR JUNIOR MORTGAGE PAYMENT                                           
                                                                                
    The data on second or junior mortgage payments were obtained from           
    questionnaire items H24a and H24b, which were asked at owner-occupied       
    one-family houses, condominiums, and mobile homes. Question H24a asks       
    whether a second or junior mortgage or a home equity loan exists on         
    the property. Question H24b provides the regular monthly amount             
    required to be paid to the lender on all second or junior mortgages         
    and home equity loans. Amounts are included even if the payments are        
    delinquent or paid by someone else. The amounts reported are included       
    in the computation of "Selected Monthly Owner Costs" and "Selected          
    Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income in 1989" for        
    units with a mortgage.                                                      
                                                                                
    All mortgages other than first mortgages are classified as "junior"         
    mortgages. A second mortgage is a junior mortgage that gives the            
    lender a claim against the property that is second to the claim of          
    the holder of the first mortgage. Any other junior mortgage(s) would        
    be subordinate to the second mortgage. A home equity loan is a line         
    of credit available to the borrower that is secured by real estate.         
    It may be placed on a property that already has a first or second           
    mortgage, or it may be placed on a property that is owned free and

    If the respondents answered that no first mortgage existed, but a           
    second mortgage did (as in the above case with a home equity loan), a       
    computer edit assigned the unit a first mortgage and made the first         
    mortgage monthly payment the amount reported in the second mortgage.        
    The second mortgage data were then made "No" in question H24a and           
    blank in question H24b.                                                     
                                                                                
    Comparability-The 1980 census obtained total regular monthly mortgage       
    payments, including payments on second or junior mortgages, from one        
    single question. Two questions were used in 1990: one for regular           
    monthly payments on first mortgages, and one for regular monthly            
    payments on second or junior mortgages and home equity loans.               
                                                                                
    SELECTED MONTHLY OWNER COSTS                                                
                                                                                
    The data on selected monthly owner costs were obtained from                 
    questionnaire items H20 through H26 for a sample of owner-occupied          
    one-family houses, condominiums, and mobile homes. Selected monthly         
    owner costs is the sum of payments for mortgages, deeds of trust,           
    contracts to purchase, or similar debts on the property (including          
    payments for the first mortgage, second or junior mortgages, and home       
    equity loans); real estate taxes; fire, hazard. and flood insurance         
    on the property; utilities (electricity, gas, and water); and fuels         
    (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.). It also includes, where                  
    appropriate, the monthly condominium fee for condominiums and mobile        
    home costs (personal property taxes, site rent, registration fees,          
    and license fees) for mobile homes.                                         
                                                                                
    In certain tabulations, selected monthly owner costs are presented          
    separately for specified owner-occupied housing units (owner-occupied       
    one-family houses on fewer than 10 acres without a business or              
    medical office on the property), owner-occupied condominiums, and           
    owner-occupied mobile homes. Data usually are shown separately for          
    units "with a mortgage" and for units "not mortgaged."                      
                                                                                
    Median Selected Monthly Owner Costs-This measure is rounded to the          
    nearest whole dollar.                                                       
                                                                                
    Comparability-The components of selected monthly owner costs were           
    collected for the first time in 1980. The 1990 tabulations of               
    selected monthly owner costs for specified owner-occupied housing           
    units are virtually identical to 1980, the primary difference was           
    the amounts of the first and second mortgages were collected in             
    separate questions in 1990, while the amounts were collected in a           
    single question in 1980. The component parts of the item were               
    tabulated for mobile homes and condominiums for the first time in 1         
    990.                                                                        
                                                                                
    In 1980, Costs for electricity and gas were collected as average

    monthly costs.  In 1990, all utility and fuel costs were collected as       
    yearly costs and divided by 12 to provide an average monthly cost.

    The information on selected monthly owner costs as a percentage of          
    household income in 1989 is the computed ratio of selected monthly          
    owner costs to monthly household income in 1989. The ratio was              
    computed separately for each unit and rounded to the nearest whole          
    percentage. The data are tabulated separately for specified                 
    owner-occupied units, condominiums, and mobile homes.                       
                                                                                
    Separate distributions are often shown for units "with a mortgage"          
    and for units "not mortgaged." Units occupied by households reporting       
    no income or a net loss in 1989 are included in the "not computed"          
    category. (For more information, see the discussion under "Selected         
    Monthly Owner Costs.")                                                      
                                                                                
    Comparability-The components of selected monthly owner costs were           
    collected for the first time in 1980. The tabulations of "Selected          
    Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income in 1989" for        
    specified owner-occupied housing units are comparable to 1980.              
                                                                                
    SEWAGE DISPOSAL                                                             
                                                                                
    The data on sewage disposal were obtained from questionnaire item           
    H16, which was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. This        
    item was asked on a sample basis. Housing units are either connected        
    to a public sewer, to a septic tank or cesspool, or they dispose of         
    sewage by other means. A public sewer may be operated by a government       
    body or by a private organization. A housing unit is considered to be       
    connected to a septic tank or cesspool when the unit is provided with       
    an underground pit or tank for sewage disposal. The category, "Other        
    means" includes housing units which dispose of sewage in some other         
    way.                                                                        
                                                                                
    Comparability-Data on sewage disposal have been collected since 1940.       
    In 1970 and 1980, data were shown only for year-round housing units.        
    In 1990, data are shown for all housing units.                              
                                                                                
    SOURCE OF WATER                                                             
                                                                                
    The data on source of water were obtained from questionnaire hem H15,       
    which was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. Housing          
    units may receive their water supply from a number of sources. A            
    common source supplying water to five or more units is classified as        
    a "Public system or private company." The water may be supplied by a        
    city, county, water district, water company, etc., or it may be             
    obtained from a well which supplies water to five or more housing

    units. If the water is supplied from a well serving four or fewer           
    housing units, the units are classified as having water supplied by         
    either an "Individual drilled well" or an "Individual dug well."            
    Drilled wells or small diameter wells are usually less than 1-1/2           
    feet in diameter. Dug wells are usually larger than 1-1/2 feet wide         
    and generally hand dug. The category, "Some other source" includes          
    water obtained from springs, creeks, rivers, lakes, cisterns, etc.          
                                                                                
    Comparability-Data on source of water have been collected since 1940.       
    In 1970 and 1980, data were shown only for year-round housing units.        
    In 1 990, data are shown for all housing units.

    The data on telephones were obtained from questionnaire item H12,           
    which was asked at occupied housing units. This item was asked on a         
    sample basis. A telephone must be inside the house or apartment for         
    the unit to be classified as having a telephone. Units where the            
    respondent uses a telephone located inside the building but not in          
    the respondent's living quarters are classified as having no                
    telephone.                                                                  
                                                                                
    Comparability-Data on telephones in 1980 are comparable to 1990. The        
    1960 and 1970 censuses collected data on telephone availability. A          
    unit was classified as having a telephone available if there was a          
    telephone number on which occupants of the unit could be reached. The       
    telephone could have been in another unit, in a common hall, or             
    outside the building.                                                       
                                                                                
    TENURE                                                                      
                                                                                
    The data for tenure were obtained from questionnaire item H4, which         
    was asked at all occupied housing units. All occupied housing units         
    are classified as either owner-occupied or renter occupied.                 
                                                                                
    Owner Occupied-A housing unit is owner-occupied if the owner or             
    co-owner lives in the unit even if it is mortgaged or not fully paid        
    for. The owner or co-owner must live in the unit and usually is the         
    person listed in column 1 of the questionnaire. The unit is "Owned by       
    you or someone in this household with a mortgage or loan" if it is          
    being purchased with a mortgage or some other debt arrangement such         
    as a deed of trust, trust deed, contract to purchase, land contract,        
    or purchase agreement. The unit is also considered owned with a             
    mortgage if it is built on leased land and there is a mortgage on the       
    unit.                                                                       
                                                                                
    A housing unit is "Owned by you or someone in this household free and       
    clear (without a mortgage)" if there is no mortgage or other similar        
    debt on the house, apartment, or mobile home including units built on       
    leased land if the unit is owned outright without a mortgage.               
    Although owner-occupied units are divided between mortgaged and owned

    free and clear on the questionnaire, census data products containing        
    100percent data show only total owner-occupied counts. More extensive       
    mortgage information was collected on the long-form questionnaire and       
    are shown in census products containing sample data. (For more              
    information, see the discussion under "Mortgage Status.")                   
                                                                                
    Renter Occupied-All occupied housing units which are not owner              
    occupied, whether they are rented for cash rent or occupied without         
    payment of cash rent, are classified as renter occupied. "No cash           
    rent" units are separately identified in the rent tabulations. Such         
    units are generally provided free by friends or relatives or in             
    exchange for services such as resident manager, caretaker, minister,        
    or tenant farmer. Housing units on military bases also are classified       
    in the "No cash rent" category. "Rented for cash rent" includes units       
    in continuing care, sometimes called life care arrangements. These          
    arrangements usually involve a contract between one or more                 
    individuals and a health services provider guaranteeing the                 
    individual shelter, usually a house or apartment, and services, such        
    as meals or transportation to shopping or recreation.                       
    Comparability-Data on tenure have been collected since 1890. In 1970,       
    the question on tenure also included a category for condominium and         
    cooperative ownership. In 1980, condominium units and cooperatives          
    were dropped from the tenure item, and since 1980, only condominium         
    units are identified in a separate question.                                
                                                                                
    For 1990, the response categories were expanded to allow the                
    respondent to report whether the unit was owned with a mortgage or          
    free and clear (without a mortgage). The distinction between units          
    owned with a mortgage and units owned free and clear was added in           
    1990 to improve the count of owner-occupied units.  Research after          
    the 1980 census indicated some respondents did not consider their           
    units owned if they had a mortgage,                                         
                                                                                
    UNITS IN STRUCTURE                                                          
                                                                                
    The data on units in structure (also referred to as "type of                
    structure") were obtained from questionnaire item H2, which was asked       
    at all housing units. A structure is a separate building that either        
    has open spaces on all sides or is separated from other structures by       
    dividing walls that extend from ground to roof. In determining the          
    number of units in a structure, all housing units, both occupied and        
    vacant, are counted. Stores and office space are excluded.                  
                                                                                
    The statistics are presented for the number of housing units in             
    structures of specified type and size, not for the number of                
    residential buildings.                                                      
                                                                                
    1-Unit, Detached-This is a 1-unit structure detached from any other         
    house; that is, with open space on all four sides. Such structures          
    are considered detached even if they have an adjoining shed or              
    garage. A one-family house that contains a business is considered

    detached as long as the building has open space on all four sides.          
    Mobile homes or trailers to which one or more permanent rooms have          
    been added or built also are included.                                      
                                                                                
    1-Unit, Attached-This is a 1-unit structure that has one or more            
    walls extending from ground to roof separating it from adjoining            
    structures. In row houses (sometimes called townhouses double houses,       
    or houses attached to nonresidential structures, each house is a            
    separate, attached structure if the dividing or common wall goes from       
    ground to roof.                                                             
                                                                                
    2 or More Units-These are units in structures containing 2 or more          
    housing units, further categorized as units in structures with 2,3 or       
    4, 5 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 49, and 50 or more units.                        
                                                                                
    Mobile Home or Trailer-Both occupied and vacant mobile homes to which       
    no permanent rooms have been added are counted in this category.            
    Mobile homes or trailers used only for business purposes or for extra       
    sleeping space and mobile homes or trailers for sale on a dealers           
    lot, at the factory, or in storage are not counted in the housing           
    inventory.                                                                  
                                                                                
    Other-This category is for any living quarters occupied as a housing        
    unit that does not fit the previous categories. Examples that fit this      
    category are houseboats, railroad cars, campers, and vans.                  
                                                                                
    Comparability-Data on units in structure have been collected since          
    1940 and on mobile homes and trailers since 1950. In 1970 and 1980,         
    these data were shown only for year-round housing units. In 1990,           
    these data are shown for all housing units. In 1980, the data were          
    collected on a sample basis. The category, "Boat, tent, van, etc."          
    was replaced in 1990 by the category "Other."  In some areas, the           
    proportion of units classified as "Other" is far larger than the            
    number of units that were classified as "Boat, tent, van, etc." in          
    1980.                                                                       
                                                                                
    USUAL HOME ELSEWHERE                                                        
                                                                                
    The data for usual home elsewhere are obtained from questionnaire           
    item B, which was completed by census employees. A housing unit             
    temporarily occupied at the time of enumeration entirely by persons         
    with a usual residence elsewhere is classified as vacant. The               
    occupants are classified as having a "Usual home elsewhere" and are         
    counted at the address of their usual place of residence.  Typical          
    examples are people in a vacation home, persons renting living              
    quarters temporarily for work, and migrant workers.                         
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data-Evidence from previous censuses suggests that        
    in some areas enumerators marked units as "vacant-usual home                
    elsewhere" when they should have marked "vacant-regular."

    Comparability-Data for usual home elsewhere was tabulated for the           
    first time in 1980.                                                         
                                                                                
    UTILITIES                                                                   
                                                                                
    The data on utility costs were obtained from questionnaire items H20a       
    through H20d, which were asked of occupied housing units. These items       
    were asked on a sample, basis.                                              
                                                                                
    Questions H20a through H20d asked for the yearly cost of utilities          
    (electricity, gas, water) and other fuels (oil, coal, wood, kerosene,       
    etc.).  For the tabulations, these yearly amounts are divided by 12         
    to derive the average monthly cost and are then included in the             
    computation of "Gross Rent," "Gross Rent as a Percentage of Household       
    Income in 1989," "Selected Monthly Owner Costs," and "Selected              
    Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income in 1989."           
                                                                                
    Costs are recorded if paid by or billed to occupants, a welfare             
    agency, relatives, or friends. Costs that are paid by landlords,            
    included in the rent payment, or included in condominium or                 
    cooperative fees are excluded Limitation of the Data-Research has           
    shown that respondents tended to overstate their expenses for               
    electricity and gas when compared to utility company records.  There        
    is some evidence that this overstatement is reduced when yearly costs       
    are asked rather than monthly costs. Caution should be exercised in         
    using these data for direct analysis because costs are not reported         
    for certain kinds of units such as renter-occupied units with all           
    utilities included in the rent and owner-occupied condominium units         
    with utilities included in the condominium fee.                             
                                                                                
    Comparability-The data on utility costs have been collected since           
    1980 for owner-occupied housing units, and since 1940 for                   
    renter-occupied housing units.  In 1980, costs for electricity and          
    gas were collected as average monthly costs.  In 1990, all utility          
    and fuel costs were collected as yearly costs and divided by 12 to          
    provide an average monthly cost.                                            
                                                                                
    VACANCY STATUS                                                              
                                                                                
    The data on vacancy status were obtained from questionnaire item C1,        
    which was completed by census enumerators. Vacancy status and other         
    characteristics of vacant units were determined by enumerators              
    obtaining information from landlords, owners, neighbors, rental             
    agents, and others. Vacant units are subdivided according to their          
    housing market classification as follows:                                   
                                                                                
    For Rent-These are vacant units offered "for rent," and vacant units        
    offered either "for rent" or "for sale."                                    
                                                                                
    For Sale Only-These are vacant units being offered "for sale only,"         
    including units in cooperatives and condominium projects if the

    individual units are offered "for sale only."                               
                                                                                
    Rented or Sold, Not Occupied-if any money rent has been paid or             
    agreed upon but the new renter has not moved in as of the date of           
    enumeration, or if the unit has recently been sold but the new owner        
    has not yet moved in, the vacant unit is classified as "rented or           
    sold, not occupied."                                                        
                                                                                
    For Seasonal Recreational, or Occasional Use-These are vacant units         
    used or intended for use only in certain seasons or for weekend or          
    other occasional use throughout the year.                                   
                                                                                
    Seasonal units include those used for summer or winter sports or            
    recreation, such as beach cottages and hunting cabins. Seasonal units       
    also may include quarters for such workers as herders and loggers.          
    Interval ownership units, sometimes called shared-ownership or              
    time-sharing condominiums, also are included here.                          
                                                                                
    For Migrant Workers-These include vacant units intended for occupancy       
    by migratory workers employed in farm work during the crop season.          
    (Work in a cannery, a freezer plant, or a food-processing plant is          
    not farm work.)                                                             
                                                                                
    Other Vacant-If a vacant unit does not fall into any of the                 
    classifications specified above, it is classified as "other vacant."        
    For example, this category includes units held for occupancy by a           
    caretaker or janitor, and units held for personal reasons of the            
    owner.                                                                      
                                                                                
    Homeowner Vacancy Rate-This is the percentage relationship between          
    the number of vacant units for sale and the total homeowner                 
    inventory. It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units for        
    sale only by the SLIM of the owner-occupied units and the number of         
    vacant units that are for sale only.                                        
                                                                                
    Rental Vacancy Rate-This is the percentage relationship of the number       
    of vacant units for rent to the total rental inventory. It is               
    computed by dividing the number of vacant units for rent by the sum         
    of the renter-occupied units and the number of vacant units for rent.       
                                                                                
    Comparability-Data on vacancy status have been collected since 1940.        
    For 1990, the category, "seasonal/ recreational/ occasional use"            
    combined vacant units classified in 1980 as "seasonal or migratory"         
    and "held for occasional use."  Also, in 1970 and 1980, housing             
    characteristics generally were presented only for year round units. In      
    1990, housing characteristics are shown for all housing units.              
                                                                                
    VALUE                                                                       
                                                                                
    The data on value (also referred to as "price asked" for vacant             
    units) were obtained from questionnaire item H6, which was asked at         
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      ICPSR 9952                                          Page 269              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    housing units that were owned, being bought, or vacant for sale at          
    the time of enumeration. Value is the respondent's estimate of how          
    much the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot, or condominium       
    unit) would sell for if it were for sale. If the house or mobile home       
    was owned or being bought, but the land on which it sits was not, the       
    respondent was asked to estimate the combined value of the house or         
    mobile home and the land. For vacant units, value was the price asked       
    for the property.                                                           
                                                                                
    Value was tabulated separately for all owner-occupied and                   
    vacant-for-sale housing units, owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale           
    mobile homes or trailers, and specified owner-occupied and specified        
    vacant-for-sale housing units. Specified owner-occupied and specified       
    vacant-for-sale housing units include only one-family houses on fewer       
    than 10 acres without a business or medical office on the property.         
    The data for "specified units" exclude mobile homes, houses with a          
    business or medical office, houses on 10 or more acres, and housing         
    units in multi-unit buildings.                                              
                                                                                
    Median and Quartile Value-The median divides the value distribution         
    into two equal parts. Quartiles divide the value distribution into          
    four equal parts.  These measures are rounded to the nearest hundred        
    dollars. (For more information on medians and quartiles, see the            
    discussion under "Derived Measures.") Aggregate Value-To calculate          
    aggregate value, the amount assigned for the category "Less than            
    $10,000" is $9,000. The amount assigned to the category "$500,000 or        
    more" is $600,000. Mean value is rounded to the nearest hundred             
    dollars. (For more information on aggregates and means, see the             
    discussion under "Derived Measures.")                                       
                                                                                
    Comparability-in 1980, value was asked only at owner-occupied or            
    vacant-for-sale one-family houses on fewer than 10 acres with no            
    business or medical office on the property and at all owner-occupied        
    or vacant-for-sale condominium housing units. Mobile homes were             
    excluded Value data were presented f or specified owner-occupied            
    housing units, specified vacant-for-sale-only housing units, and            
    owner-occupied condominium housing units.                                   
                                                                                
    In 1990, the question was asked at all owner-occupied or                    
    vacant-for-sale-only housing units with no exclusions. Data presented       
    for specified owner-occupied and specified vacant-for-sale-only             
    housing units will include one-family condominium houses but not            
    condominiums in multi-unit structures since condominium units are now       
    identified only in long-form questionnaires.                                
                                                                                
    For 1990, quartiles have been added because the range of values and         
    rents in the United States has increased in recent years. Upper and         
    lower quartiles can be used to note large value and rent differences        
    among various geographic areas.                                             
                                                                                
    VEHICLES AVAILABLE

    The data on vehicles available were obtained from questionnaire item        
    H13, which was asked at occupied housing units. This item was asked         
    on a sample basis.  These data show the number of households with a         
    specified number of passenger cars, vans, and pickup or panel trucks        
    of one-ton capacity or less kept at home and available for the use of       
    household members. Vehicles rented or leased for one month or more,         
    company vehicles, and police and government vehicles are included if        
    kept at home and used for nonbusiness purposes. Dismantled or               
    immobile vehicles are excluded. Vehicles kept at home but used only         
    for business purposes also are excluded.                                    
                                                                                
    Vehicles Per Household-This is computed by dividing aggregate               
    vehicles available by the number of occupied housing units.                 
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data-The 1980 census evaluations showed that the          
    number of automobiles was slightly overreported; the number of vans         
    and trucks slightly underreported. The statistics do not measure the        
    number of vehicles privately owned or the number of households owning       
    vehicles.                                                                   
                                                                                
    Comparability-Data on automobiles available were collected from 1960        
    to 1980.  In 1980, a separate question also was asked on the number         
    of trucks and vans.  The data on automobiles and trucks and vans were       
    presented separately and also as a combined vehicles available              
    tabulation. The 1990 data are comparable to the 1980 vehicles               
    available tabulations.                                                      
                                                                                
    YEAR HOUSEHOLDER MOVED INTO UNIT                                            
                                                                                
    The data on year householder moved into unit were obtained from             
    questionnaire item H8, which was asked at occupied housing units.           
    This item was asked on a sample basis. These data refer to the year         
    of the latest move by the householder. If a householder moved back          
    into a housing unit he or she previously occupied, the year of the          
    latest move was reported. If the householder moved from one apartment       
    to another within the same building, the year the householder moved         
    into the present apartment was reported. The intent is to establish         
    the year the present occupancy by the householder began. The year           
    that the householder moved in is not necessarily the same year other        
    members of the household moved, although in the great majority of           
    cases an entire household moves at the same time. Comparability-In          
    1960 and 1970, this question was asked of every person and included         
    in population reports. This item in housing tabulations refers to the       
    year the householder moved in. In 1980 and 1990, the question was           
    asked only of the householder.                                              
                                                                                
    YEAR STRUCTURE BUILT                                                        
                                                                                
    The data on year structure built were obtained from questionnaire           
    item H17, which was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units.        
    This item was asked on a sample basis. Data on year structure built

    refer to when the building was first constructed, not when it was           
    remodeled, added to, or converted. For housing units under                  
    construction that met the housing unit definition-that is, all              
    exterior windows, doors, and final usable floors were in place-the          
    category "1989 or March 1990" was used. For a houseboat or a mobile         
    home or trailer, the manufacturers model year was assumed to be the         
    year built. The figures shown in census data products relate to the         
    number of units built during the specified periods that were still in       
    existence at the time of enumeration.                                       
                                                                                
    Median Year Structure Built-The median divides the distribution into        
    two equal parts. The median is rounded to the nearest calendar year.        
    Median age of housing can be obtained by subtracting median year            
    structure built from 1990.  For example, if the median year structure       
    built is 1957, the median age of housing in that area is 33 years           
    (1990 minus 1957).                                                          
                                                                                
    Limitation of the Data-Data on year structure built are more                
    susceptible to errors of response and nonreporting than data on many        
    other items because respondents must rely on their memory or on             
    estimates by persons who have lived in the neighborhood a long time.        
    Available evidence indicates there is underreporting in the                 
    older-year-structure-built categories, especially "Built in 1939 or         
    earlier." The introduction of the "Don't know" category (see the            
    discussion on "Comparability") may have resulted in relatively higher       
    allocation rates.                                                           
                                                                                
    Comparability-Data on year structure built were collected for the           
    first time in the 1940 census. Since then, the response categories          
    have been modified to accommodate the 10-year period between each           
    census. In 1990, the category, "Don't Know," was added in an effort         
    to minimize the response error mentioned in the paragraph above on          
    limitation of the data.                                                     
                                                                                
    DERIVED MEASURES                                                            
                                                                                
    Census data products include various derived measures, such as              
    medians, means, and percentages, as well as certain rates and ratios.       
    Derived measures that round to less than 0.1 are not shown but              
    indicated as zero. In printed reports, zero is indicated by a dash          
    (-)                                                                         
                                                                                
    Interpolation                                                               
                                                                                
    Interpolation frequently is used in calculating medians or quartiles        
    based on interval data and in approximating standard errors from            
    tables. Linear interpolation is used to estimate values of a function       
    between two known values. "Pareto interpolation" is an alternative to       
    linear interpolation. It is used by the Census Bureau in calculating        
    median income within intervals wider than $2,500. In Pareto                 
    interpolation, the median is derived by interpolating between the

    logarithms of the upper and lower income limits of the median               
    category.

    This measure represents an arithmetic average of a set of values. It        
    is derived by dividing the sum of a group of numerical items (or            
    aggregate) by the total number of items. Aggregates are used in             
    computing mean values. For example, mean family income is obtained by       
    dividing the aggregate of all income reported by persons in families        
    by the total number of families. (Additional information on means and       
    aggregates is included in the separate explanations of many                 
    population and housing subjects.)                                           
                                                                                
    Median                                                                      
                                                                                
    This measure represents the middle value in a distribution. The             
    median divides the total frequency into two equal parts: one-half of        
    the cases fall below the median and one-half of the cases exceed the        
    median. The median is computed on the basis of the distribution as          
    tabulated, which is sometimes more detailed than the distribution           
    shown in specific census publications and other data products.              
                                                                                
    In reports, if the median falls within the upper interval of the            
    tabulation distribution, the median is shown as the initial value of        
    the interval followed by a plus sign (+); if within the lower               
    interval, the median is shown as the upper value of the category            
    followed by a minus sign (-). For summary tape files, if the median         
    falls within the upper or lower interval, it is set to a specified          
    value. (Additional information on medians is included in the separate       
    explanations of many population and housing subjects.)                      
                                                                                
    Percentages, Rates, and Ratios                                              
                                                                                
    These measures are frequently presented in census products to compare       
    two numbers or two sets of measurements. These comparisons are made         
    in two ways: (1) subtraction, which provides an absolute measure of         
    the difference between two items, and (2) the quotient of two               
    numbers, which provides a relative measure of difference.                   
                                                                                
    Quartile                                                                    
                                                                                
    This measure divides a distribution into four equal parts. The first        
    quartile (or lower quartile) is the value that defines the upper            
    limit of the lowest one-quarter of the cases. The second quartile is        
    the median. The third quartile (or upper quartile) defines the lower        
    limit of the upper one-quarter of the cases in the distribution. The        
    difference between the upper and lower quartiles is called the              
    interquartile range. This interquartile range is less affected by           
    wide variations than is the mean. Quartiles are presented for certain       
    financial characteristics such as housing value and rent.

            Areatype is a description of the geographic characteristics

            and 5% samples.  Any county, county equivalent, place, etc.,        
            which had more than 200,000 persons could be subdivided into        
            more than one PUMA as long as the resultant grouping had a

            We are including weights for each housing unit.  These              
            weights can be summed to get estimates of specific housing          
            unit characteristics.  See chapter 3 for a discussion on the        
            proper use of these weights.

            Users interested in tabulating household size or the number         
            of persons in the housing unit unit may use this item,              
            provided that records for persons in group quarters are first       
            screened out.  Persons-in-group-quarters records are                
            identified by codes of 1-2 in H35 (Group Quarters                   
            Institution) or by codes 12-13 in P9-10 (Relationship).

            Because of disclosure concerns, the only characteristic that        
            will be shown describing group quarters is whether it is an         
            institutional or noninstitutional group quarters.

    and             The criteria used was whether the topcode protected         
    P127-182        either 1/2 of 1% of the total universe or 3% of the         
                    cases with the characteristic.  In most instances, we       
                    used the value that was more favorable to the user.         
                    In all topcoded situations, if there were at least 30       
                    cases above the topcoded amount we provided the state       
                    median of all values above the topcode.  Pay close          
                    attention to the period covered by the estimate (some       
                    are monthly, others annual).  A complete list of            
                    topcoded variables and respective state medians is in       
                    the User Note chapter.                                      
                                                                                
    H111-128        GROSS RENT as a % of HH Income

            These variables are calculated from the topcoded components,        
            and, in those cases where original amounts were topcoded,           
            either the topcode or the medians were used.  In those              
            situations, the proportion of income represented may not            
            match distributions found on other products from sample data.       
                                                                                
            For those components which required monthly averages, we            
            computed, and rounded the monthly average from the reported         
            annual data.

            Unlike current residence, the PUMAs for migration and               
            place-of-work data are defined only to the whole county,            
            county equivalent, or place level for PUMS.  Therefore, it is       
            not possible to tabulate either migration or place of work to       
            the "group of census tracts level".

                        In wards in general and military hospitals for          
                            patients who have no usual home elsewhere;          
                        In hospitals or wards for the chronically ill;          
                        In military stockades or jails;                         
                        In crews of civilian vessels;

    P183    Augmented Person                                                    
                                                                                
            In rare instances during the implementation of the sample           
            weighting process, the sample size was considered inadequate        
            to make estimates of sample data.  In collection block groups       
            with a designated 1-in-2 sampling rate, augmentation was            
            employed if the 100% housing unit count was at least 6 and          
            the observed sampling rate was less than 1-in-12.  In               
            collection block groups with a designated 1-in-6 or 1-in-8          
            sampling rate, augmentation was employed if the 100% housing        
            unit was at least 12 and the observed sampling rate was less        
            than 1-in-30.  Augmentation was performed separately for            
            group quarters persons using the same criteria as for the           
            1-in-6 or 1-in-8 designated sampling rates.  Augmentation was       
            achieved by selecting a sample of housing units (or group           
            quarters persons) to increase the observed sampling rates to        
            at least 1-in-12 or 1-in-30.  Using the 100% characteristics,       
            the selected households (or group quarters persons) were            
            matched by a hot deck procedure to similar housing units (or        
            group quarters persons) with sample data.  The sample data          
            were then copied to the augmented housing units (or group

    COMPARING ESTIMATES FROM PUMS TO OTHER CENSUS DATA                          
                                                                                
    Users of the PUMS files should be aware that estimates derived from         
    these files are subject to sampling variability as with statistics          
    derived from any sample.                                                    
                                                                                
    Sampling variability increases as the sample size decreases.                
    Therefore, estimates derived from the full census sample are more           
    reliable than the corresponding estimates from the PUMS data                
    products. Estimates in standard sample data products, such as summary       
    tape files (STF 3 and 4) and the reports from the characteristics of        
    population and housing series (CPH-3, 4, and 5) are more adequate           
    than the corresponding estimates from the PUMS files, particularly          
    for rare populations and population subgroups.                              
                                                                                
    The PUMS files are produced by processing the full census sample            
    through a second sampling operation. Given the census sample, the           
    PUMS estimates are unbiased. This means that the average value of the       
    estimated characteristic over all possible PUMS samples would match         
    the estimate from the full census sample. In general, the PUMS              
    estimates are no more biased than the census sample estimates.              
    Subsampling the census sample to produce the PUMS files increases the       
    variance of the estimates derived from these data products. In              
    general, the variance of an estimate derived from the 5-percent PUMS        
    is about 4 times the variance of the same estimate derived from the         
    full census sample. For the 1-percent PUMS, the variance increases by       
    a factor of about 20.                                                       
                                                                                
    As an example, consider the census sample and the 1-percent PUMS            
    estimate for the characteristic NUMBER OF FAMILIES WITH 1 WORKER for        
    a given metropolitan area. The total number of families is 200,000.

    the PUMS estimate is about 20 times that of the full census estimate.       
    The standard error of an estimate is the square root of the variance.       
    The variance of the full census estimate is the square root of the          
    variance. The variance of the full census estimate is (714) 2, while        
    the corresponding PUMS estimate has variance (3219) 2 . The figure in       
    parenthesis is the standard error of the estimate. The user should          
    refer to Chapter 3 - Accuracy of the Data - of the PUMS technical           
    documentation for a detailed explanation on how to compute variance         
    estimates. It is important to note that although the ratio of the           
    variances is about 20, the coefficient of variation (CV) of the PUMS        
    estimate is about 4.4 percent. The CV measures the reliability (or          
    adequacy) of an estimate. A CV of less that 20 percent is considered        
    adequate in most cases.                                                     
                                                                                
    SHOULD THE ESTIMATES BE EQUAL? Is the difference between the estimate       
    derived from the full census sample and that derived from the PUMS --       
    4,446 families with 1 worker -- due to sampling?                            
                                                                                
    Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing are used to answer the          
    above questions. We want to address the question as to whether we           
    should be concerned by the size of the difference between the two           
    estimates.                                                                  
                                                                                
    If we add and subtract two standard errors from the PUMS estimate, we       
    develop a 95-percent confidence interval. If the full census sample         
    estimate falls in the interval, then it can be concluded that the           
    difference is within sampling variability. In this case, the                
    95-percent confidence interval around the PUMS estimate is 67,132 to        
    80,008, which includes the census sample estimate, 69,124.  This            
    suggests that the difference should not be cause for concern.               
                                                                                
    Data users should be especially cautious in using estimates for rare        
    populations or population subgroups since these estimates can be            
    expected to vary widely from the figures derived from the full census       
    sample.

    Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data users can combine the               
    1-percent and the 5-percent PUMS files and compute estimates based on       
    a 6 percent sample.  Estimates from a 6 percent sample are more             
    reliable, however additional computations are required to produce           
    estimates and standard error estimates.  The user must decide whether       
    the increase in reliability is enough to compensate for the                 
    additional computational work and cost to produce estimates from the        
    6 percent sample.

    HOW TO COMPUTE ESTIMATES FROM THE 6 PERCENT SAMPLE                          
                                                                                
    The PUMS weight is a function of the census sample weight (see              
    Chapter 3 of the PUMS Technical Documentation).  The census sample          
    weight is not included in either the housing or the person record of        
    the PUMS files.  Therefore, it is not possible to compute a new PUMS        
    weight based of the 6 percent sample.                                       
                                                                                
    To compute estimates from the 6 percent sample (for a geographic            
    area, say, Metropolitan Area estimates) we suggest the following            
    method.

    Users can combine the elderly records from the 1-percent and                
    5-percent samples with the 3-percent Elderly sample to produce more         
    reliable estimates for the elderly population.  To get estimates and        
    approximation of variances from the 9 percent sample, follow the

    In accordance with census practice dating back to the first United          
    States census in 1790, each person was to be enumerated as an               
    inhabitant of his or her "usual residence" in the 1990 census.  Usual       
    residence is the place where the person lives and sleeps most of the        
    time or considers to be his or her usual residence.  This place is          
    not necessarily the same as the person's legal residence or voting          
    residence.  In the vast majority of cases, however, the use of these        
    different bases of classification would produce substantially the           
    same statistics, although there might be appreciable differences for        
    a few areas.                                                                
                                                                                
    The implementation of this practice has resulted in the establishment       
    of rules for certain categories of persons whose usual place of             
    residence is not immediately apparent.  Furthermore, this practice          
    means that persons were not always counted as residents of the place        
    where they happened to be staying on Census Day (April 1, 1990).            
                                                                                
    ENUMERATION RULES                                                           
                                                                                
    Each person whose usual residence was in the United States was to be        
    included in the census, without regard to the person's legal status         
    or citizenship.  In a departure from earlier censuses, foreign              
    diplomatic personnel participated voluntarily in the census,                
    regardless of their residence on or off the premises of an embassy.         
    As in previous censuses, persons in the United States specifically          
    excluded from the census were foreign travelers who had not                 
    established a residence.                                                    
                                                                                
    Americans with a usual residence outside the United States were not         
    enumerated in the 1990 census.  United States military and Federal          
    civilian employees, and their dependents overseas, are included in          
    the population counts for States for purposes of Congressional              
    apportionment, but are excluded from all other tabulations for States       
    and their subdivisions.  The counts of United States military and           
    Federal civilian employees, and their dependents, were obtained from        
    administrative records maintained by Federal departments and

    international agencies and private businesses and students, were not        
    enumerated nor were their counts obtained from administrative               
    sources.  On the other hand, Americans temporarily overseas were to         
    be enumerated at their usual residence in the United States.                
                                                                                
    RESIDENCE RULES                                                             
                                                                                
    Each person included in the census was to be counted at his or her          
    usual residence--the place where he or she lives and sleeps most of         
    the time or the place where the person considers to be his or her           
    usual home.  If a person had no usual residence, the person was to be       
    counted where he or she was staying on April 1, 1990.                       
                                                                                
    Persons temporarily away from their usual residence, whether in the         
    United States or overseas, on a vacation or on a business trip, were        
    counted at their usual residence.  Persons who occupied more than one       
    residence during the year were counted at the one they considered to        
    be their usual residence.  Persons who moved on or near Census Day          
    were counted at the place they considered to be their usual                 
    residence.                                                                  
                                                                                
    PERSONS IN THE ARMED FORCES--Members of the Armed Forces were counted       
    as residents of the area in which the installation was located,             
    either on the installation or in the surrounding community.  Family         
    members of Armed Forces personnel were counted where they were living       
    on Census Day (for example, with the Armed Forces person or at              
    another location).                                                          
                                                                                
    Each Navy ship not deployed to the 6th or 7th Fleet was attributed to       
    the municipality that the Department of the Navy designated as its          
    homeport.  If the homeport included more than one municipality, ships       
    berthed there on Census Day were assigned by the Bureau of the Census       
    to the municipality in which the land immediately adjacent to the           
    dock or pier was actually located Ships attributed to the homeport,         
    but not physically present and not deployed to the 6th or 7th Fleet,        
    were assigned to the municipality named on the Department of the            
    Navy's homeport list.  These rules also apply to Coast Guard vessels.       
                                                                                
    Personnel assigned to each Navy and Coast Guard ship were given the         
    opportunity to report a residence off the ship.  Those who did report       
    an off-ship residence in the communities surrounding the homeport           
    were counted there; those who did not were counted as residents of          
    the ship.  Personnel on Navy ships deployed to the 6th or 7th Fleet         
    on Census Day were considered to be part of the overseas population.        
                                                                                
    PERSONS ON MARITIME SHIPS--Persons aboard maritime ships who reported       
    an off-ship residence were counted at that residence.  Those who did        
    not were counted as residents of the ship, and were attributed as           
    follows:                                                                    
                                                                                
        1.  The port where the ship was docked on Census Day, if that

            port was in the United States or its possessions.                   
                                                                                
        2.  The port of departure if the ship was at sea, provided the          
            port was in the United States or its possessions.                   
                                                                                
        3.  The port of destination in the United States or its                 
            possessions, if the port of departure of a ship at sea was a        
            foreign port.                                                       
                                                                                
       4.   The overseas population if the ship was docked at a foreign         
            port or at sea between foreign ports. (These persons were not       
            included in the overseas population for apportionment               
            purposes.)                                                          
                                                                                
    PERSONS AWAY AT SCHOOL--College students were counted as residents of       
    the area in which they were living while attending college, as they         
    have been since the 1950 census.  Children in boarding schools below        
    the college level were counted at their parental home.                      
                                                                                
    PERSONS IN INSTITUTIONS--Persons under formally authorized,                 
    supervised care or custody, such as in Federal or State prisons;            
    local jails; Federal detention centers; juvenile institutions;              
    nursing, convalescent, and rest homes for the aged and dependent; or        
    homes, schools, hospitals, or wards for the physically handicapped,         
    mentally retarded, or mentally ill, were counted at these places.           
                                                                                
    PERSONS AWAY FROM THEIR USUAL RESIDENCE ON CENSUS DAY--Migrant              
    agricultural workers who did not report a usual residence elsewhere         
    were counted as residents of the place where they were on Census Day.       
    Persons in worker camps who did not report a usual residence                
    elsewhere were counted as residents of the camp where they were on          
    Census Day.  In some parts of the country, natural disasters                
    displaced significant numbers of households from their usual place of       
    residence.  If these persons reported a destroyed or damaged                
    residence as their usual residence, they were counted at that               
    location.                                                                   
                                                                                
    Persons away from their usual residence were counted by means of            
    interviews with other members of their families, resident managers,         
    or neighbors.                                                               
                                                                                
    DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES                                                  
                                                                                
    The 1990 census was conducted primarily through self-enumeration.           
    The questionnaire packet included general information about the 1990        
    census and an instruction guide explaining how to complete the              
    questionnaire.  Spanish-language questionnaires and instruction             
    guides were available on request.  Instruction guides also were             
    available in 32 other languages.                                            
                                                                                
    ENUMERATION OF HOUSING UNITS                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      Page 298                                          ICPSR 9952              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    Each housing unit in the country received one of two versions of the        
    census questionnaire:                                                       
                                                                                
        1.  A short-form questionnaire that contained a limited number of       
            basic population and housing questions; these questions were        
            asked of all persons and housing units and are often referred       
            to as 100-percent questions.                                        
                                                                                
        2.  A long-form questionnaire that contained the 100-percent            
            items and a number of additional questions; a sampling              
            procedure was used to determine those housing units that were       
            to receive the long-form questionnaire.                             
                                                                                
    Three sampling rates were employed.  For slightly more than one-half        
    of the country, one in every six housing units (about 17 percent)           
    received the long-form or sample questionnaire.  In functioning local       
    governmental units (counties and incorporated places, and in some           
    parts of the country, towns and townships) estimated to have fewer          
    than 2,500 inhabitants, every other housing unit (50 percent)               
    received the sample questionnaire in order to enhance the reliability       
    of the sample data for these small areas.  For census tracts and            
    block numbering areas having more than 2,000 housing units in the           
    Census Bureau's address files, one in every eight housing units             
    (about 13 percent) received a sample questionnaire, providing               
    reliable statistics for these areas while permitting the Census             
    Bureau to stay within a limit of 17.7 million sample questionnaires,        
    or a one-in-six sample, nationwide.                                         
                                                                                
    The mail-out/mail-back procedure was used mainly in cities, suburban        
    areas, towns, and rural areas where mailing addresses consisted of a        
    house number and street name.                                               
                                                                                
    In these areas, the Census Bureau developed mailing lists that              
    included about 88.4 million addresses.  The questionnaires were             
    delivered through the mail and respondents were to return them by           
    mail.  Census questionnaires were delivered 1 week before Census Day        
    (April 1, 1990)                                                             
                                                                                
    The update/leave/mail-back method was used mainly in densely                
    populated rural areas where it was difficult to develop mailing lists       
    because mailing addresses did not use house number and street name.         
    The Census Bureau compiled lists of housing units in advance of the         
    census.  Enumerators delivered the questionnaires, asked respondents        
    to return them by mail, and added housing units not on the mailing          
    lists.  This method was used mainly in the South and Midwest, and           
    also included some highrise, low-income urban areas.  A variation of        
    this method was used in urban areas having large numbers of                 
    boarded-up buildings.  About 11 million housing units were enumerated       
    using this method.                                                          
                                                                                
    The list/enumerate method (formerly called conventional or

    door-to-door enumeration) was used mainly in very remote and                
    sparsely-settled areas.  The United States Postal Service delivered         
    unaddressed short-form questionnaires before Census Day.  Starting a        
    week before Census Day, enumerators canvassed these areas, checked          
    that all housing units received a questionnaire, created a list of          
    all housing units, completed long-form questionnaires, and picked up        
    the completed short-form questionnaires.  This method was used mainly       
    in the West and Northeast to enumerate an estimated 6.5 million             
    housing units.                                                              
                                                                                
    FOLLOWUP                                                                    
                                                                                
    NONRESPONSE FOLLOWUP--In areas where respondents were to mail back          
    their questionnaires, an enumerator visited each address from which a       
    questionnaire was not received.                                             
                                                                                
    COVERAGE AND EDIT-FAILURE FOLLOWUP--In the mailback areas, some             
    households returned a questionnaire that did not meet specific              
    quality standards because of incomplete or inconsistent information,        
    or the respondent had indicated difficulty in deciding who was to be        
    listed on the questionnaire.  These households were contacted by            
    telephone or by personal visit to obtain the missing information or         
    to clarify who was to be enumerated in the household.  In areas where       
    an enumerator picked up the questionnaires, the enumerator checked          
    the respondent-filled questionnaire for completeness and consistency.       
                                                                                
    SPECIAL ENUMERATION PROCEDURES                                              
                                                                                
    Special procedures and questionnaires were used for the enumeration         
    of persons in group quarters, such as college dormitories, nursing          
    homes, prisons, military barracks, and ships.  The questionnaires           
    (individual Census Reports, Military Census Reports, and Shipboard          
    Census Reports) included the 100-percent population questions but did       
    not include any housing questions.  In all group quarters, all              
    persons were asked the basic population questions; in most group            
    quarters, additional questions were asked of a sample (one-in-six) of       
    persons.                                                                    
                                                                                
    SHELTER AND STREET NIGHT (S-NIGHT)                                          
                                                                                
    The Census Bureau collected data for various components of the              
    homeless population at different stages in the 1990 census.  "Shelter       
    and Street Night" (S-Night) was a special census operation to count         
    the population in four types of locations where homeless people are         
    found.  On the evening of March 20, 1990, and during the early              
    morning hours of March 21, 1990, enumerators counted persons in             
    pre-identified locations:                                                   
                                                                                
        1.  Emergency shelters for the homeless population (public and          
            private; permanent and temporary).

        2.  Shelters with temporary lodging for runaway youth.                  
                                                                                
        3.  Shelters for abused women and their children.                       
                                                                                
        4.  Open locations in streets or other places not intended for          
            habitation.                                                         
                                                                                
    Emergency shelters include all hotels and motels costing $12 or less        
    (excluding taxes) per night regardless of whether persons living            
    there considered themselves to be homeless, hotels and motels               
    (regardless of cost) used entirely to shelter homeless persons, and         
    pre-identified rooms in hotels and motels used for homeless persons         
    and families.  Enumeration in shelters usually occurred from 6 p.m.         
    to midnight; street enumeration, from 2 a.m.  to 4 a.m.; abandoned          
    and boarded-up buildings from 4 a.m.  to 8 a.m.; and shelters for           
    abused women, from 6 p.m.  on March 20 to noon on March 21.                 
                                                                                
    Other components, which some consider as part of the homeless               
    population, were enumerated as part of regular census operations.           
    These include persons doubled up with other families, as well as            
    persons with no other usual home living in transient sites, such as         
    commercial campgrounds, maternity homes for unwed mothers, and              
    drug/alcohol abuse detoxification centers.  In institutions, such as        
    local jails and mental hospitals, the Census Bureau does not know who       
    has a usual home elsewhere; therefore, even though some are literally       
    homeless, these persons cannot be identified separately as a                
    component of the homeless population.                                       
                                                                                
    There is no generally agreed-upon definition of "the homeless," and         
    there are limitations in the census count that prevent obtaining a          
    total count of the homeless population under any definition.  As            
    such, the Census Bureau does not have a definition and will not             
    provide a total count of "the homeless."  Rather, the Census Bureau         
    will provide counts and characteristics of persons found at the time        
    of the census in selected types of living arrangements.  These              
    selected components can be used as building blocks to construct a           
    count of homeless persons appropriate to particular purposes as long        
    as the data limitations are taken into account.                             
                                                                                
    In preparation for "Shelter-and-Street-Night" enumeration, the              
    regional census centers (RCC's) mailed a certified letter (Form D-33        
    (L)) to the highest elected official of each active functioning             
    government of the United States (more than 39,000) requesting them to       
    identify:                                                                   
                                                                                
        1.  All shelters with sleeping facilities (permanent and                
            temporary, such as church basements, armories, public               
            buildings, and so forth, that could be open on March 20).           
                                                                                
        2.  Hotels and motels used to house homeless persons and                
            families.                                                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      ICPSR 9952                                          Page 301              
                                                                                
                                                                                
        3.  A list of outdoor locations where homeless persons tend to be       
            at night.                                                           
                                                                                
        4.  Places such as bus or train stations, subway stations,              
            airports, hospital emergency rooms, and so forth, where             
            homeless persons seek shelter at night.                             
                                                                                
        5.  The specific addresses of abandoned or boarded-up buildings         
            where homeless persons were thought to stay at night.               
                                                                                
    The letter from the RCC's to the governmental units emphasized the          
    importance of listing night-time congregating sites.  The list of           
    shelters was expanded using information from administrative records         
    and informed local sources.  The street sites were limited to the           
    list provided by the jurisdictions.  All governmental units were            
    eligible for "Shelter and Street Night."  For cities with 50,000 or         
    more persons, the Census Bureau took additional steps to update the         
    list of shelter and street locations if the local jurisdiction did          
    not respond to the certified letter. Smaller cities and rural areas         
    participated if the local jurisdiction provided the Census Bureau a         
    list of shelters or open public places to visit or if shelters were         
    identified through our inventory development, local knowledge update,       
    or during the Special Place Prelist operation.                              
                                                                                
    The Census Bureau encouraged persons familiar with homeless persons         
    and the homeless themselves to apply as enumerators.  This recruiting       
    effort was particularly successful in larger cities.                        
                                                                                
    For shelters, both long and short-form Individual Census Reports            
    (ICR's) were distributed.  For street enumeration, only short-form          
    ICR's were used.  Persons in shelter's and at street locations were         
    asked the basic population questions.  Additional questions about           
    social and economic characteristics were asked of a sample of persons       
    in shelters only.                                                           
                                                                                
    Enumerators were instructed not to ask who was homeless; rather, they       
    were told to count all persons (including children) staying overnight       
    at the shelters, and everyone they saw on the street except the             
    police, other persons in uniform, and persons engaged in employment         
    or obvious money-making activities other than begging and                   
    panhandling.                                                                
                                                                                
    At both shelter and street sites, persons found sleeping were not           
    awakened to answer questions.  Rather, the enumerator answered the          
    sex and race questions by observation and estimated the person's age        
    to the best of his or her ability.  In shelters, administrative             
    records and information from the shelter operator were used, when           
    available, for persons who were already asleep.                             
                                                                                
    Less than 1 percent of shelters refused to participate in the census        
    count at first. By the end of the census period, most of those

    eventually cooperated and the number of refusals had been reduced to        
    a few.  For the final refusals, head counts and population                  
    characteristics were obtained by enumerators standing outside such          
    shelters and counting people as they left in the morning.                   
                                                                                
    The "street" count was restricted to persons who were visible when          
    the enumerator came to the open, public locations that had been             
    identified by local jurisdictions. Homeless persons who were well           
    hidden, moving about, or in locations other than those identified by        
    the local governments were likely missed.  The number missed will           
    never be known and there is no basis to make an estimate of the             
    number missed from census data.  The count of persons in open, public       
    places was affected by many factors, including the extra efforts made       
    to encourage people to go to shelters for "Shelter and Street Night,"       
    the weather (which was unusually cold in many parts of the country),        
    the presence of the media, and distrust of the census.  Expectations        
    of the number of homeless persons on the street cannot be based on          
    the number seen during the day because the night-time situation is          
    normally very different as more homeless persons are in shelters or         
    very well hidden.                                                           
                                                                                
    For both "Shelter-and-Street-Night" locations, the Census Bureau            
    assumed that the usual home of those enumerated was in the block            
    where they were found (shelter or street).                                  
                                                                                
    The "Shelter-and-Street-Night" operation replaced and expanded the          
    1980 Mission Night (M-Night) and Casual Count operations.  These two        
    operations were aimed at counting the population who reported having        
    no usual residence.  M-Night was conducted a week after Census Day,         
    in April 1980.  Enumerators visited hotels, motels, and similar             
    places costing $4 or less each night; missions, flophouses, local           
    jails and similar places at which the average length of stay was 30         
    days or less; and nonshelter locations, such as bus depots, train           
    stations, and all night movie theaters.  Questions were asked of            
    everyone, regardless of age.  Enumerators conducted M-Night up to           
    midnight on April 8, 1980, and returned the next morning to collect         
    any forms completed after midnight.                                         
                                                                                
    The Casual Count operation was conducted in May 1980 at additional          
    nonshelter locations, such as street corners, pool halls, welfare and       
    employment offices.  This operation lasted for approximately 2 weeks.       
    Casual Count was conducted during the day only in selected large            
    central cities.  Only persons who appeared to be at least 15 years of       
    age were asked if they had been previously enumerated Casual Count          
    was actually a coverage-improvement operation.  It was not                  
    specifically an operation to count homeless persons living in the           
    streets.  Persons were excluded if they said they had a usual home          
    outside the city because it was not cost effective to check through         
    individual questionnaires in another city to try to find the person.

    Respondents returned many census questionnaires by mail to 1 of over        
    344 census district offices or to one of six processing offices.  In        
    these offices, the questionnaires were "checked in" and edited for          
    completeness and consistency of the responses.  After this initial          
    processing had been performed, all questionnaires were sent to the          
    processing offices.                                                         
                                                                                
    In the processing offices, the household questionnaires were                
    microfilmed and processed by the Film Optical Sensing Device for            
    Input to Computers (FOSDIC).  For most items on the questionnaire,          
    the information supplied by the respondent was indicated by filling         
    circles in predesignated positions.  FOSDIC electronically "read"           
    these filled circles from the microfilm copy of the questionnaire and       
    transferred the information to computer tape.  The computer tape did        
    not include individual names, addresses, or handwritten responses.          
                                                                                
    The data processing was performed in several stages.  All                   
    questionnaires were microfilmed, "read" by FOSDIC, and transferred to       
    computer disk.  Selected written entries in the race question on both       
    the short and long forms were keyed from the microfilm and coded            
    using the data base developed from the 1980 census and subsequent           
    content and operational tests.  Keying of other written entries on          
    the long forms occurred in the seven processing offices.                    
                                                                                
    The information (for example, income dollar amounts or homeowner            
    shelter costs) on these keyed files was merged with the FOSDIC data         
    or processed further through one of three automated coding programs.        
    The codes for industry, occupation, place-of-birth, migration,              
    place-of-work, ancestry, language, relationship, race, and Hispanic         
    origin were merged with the FOSDIC data for editing weighting, and          
    tabulating operations at Census Bureau headquarters.  All responses         
    to the questions on Individual Census Reports (ICR's), Military             
    Census Reports (MCR's), and Shipboard Census Reports (SCR's) were

    The 1990 census data products, being released during 1991-93, are           
    available in a variety of new and traditional media.  The Census            
    Bureau has increased the product options available to data users in         
    an effort to meet a variety of requirements and maximize the                
    usefulness of the data.  For example, laser discs, called CD-ROM            
    (compact disc-read-only memory), are a new data delivery medium.            
                                                                                
    The Census Bureau also has expanded services and sources of                 
    assistance available to data users.  For example, the State Data            
    Center Program has been expanded to include over 1,400 organizations        
    to provide data and services to the public.                                 
                                                                                
    This appendix provides a detailed introduction to the 1990 census           
    data products and related materials, such as maps and reference             
    publications.  It concludes by describing sources of assistance and         
    other Census Bureau data available to the public.

    Printed reports and computer tape files traditionally are the most          
    widely used products.  The Census Bureau also offers data on                
    microfiche, on CD-ROM laser discs, and through its online service,          
    CENDATA (TM).  These various products are described below.  For

    The data products present statistics about the subjects covered in          
    the 1990 census questionnaires.  These subjects are listed in figure        
    3, page F-8.  As the figure shows, there are 100-percent subjects           
    (those covered in questions asked of everyone or about every housing        
    unit) and sample subjects (those covered in questions asked at about        
    one out of every six housing units).  Generally, a data product             
    presents either 100-percent data prepared by tabulating the responses       
    to the 100-percent questions from all questionnaires, or sample data        
    prepared by tabulating only the responses to the 100-percent and            
    sample questions from the "long-form" questionnaires.

    Printed reports are the most convenient and readily available source        
    of data for most census users.  The Census Bureau releases the              
    reports in several series (see figure 4) that are grouped under three       
    broad titles: 1990 Census of Population and Housing (1990 CPH), 1990        
    Census of Population (1990 CP), and 1990 Census of Housing (1990 CH).       
    There also are reports, not reflected in figure 4, for the outlying         
    areas of the Pacific.  The reports are sold by the Superintendent of        
    Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office.  (See the "Sources of           
    Assistance" section for the address and phone number.)                      
                                                                                
    In several series, there are separate reports for each State.  The          
    geographic coverage of the State reports is listed in figure 4.  The        
    United States summaries for these report series contain, for the most       
    part, data for the United States, regions, divisions, States,               
    metropolitan areas (MA's), urbanized areas (UA's), counties, American       
    Indian and Alaska Native areas, places with 10,000 or more persons,         
    and other large substate areas (for example, county subdivisions,           
    such as towns and townships, with 10,000 or more persons in selected        
    States).                                                                    
                                                                                
    Report series that present data for small areas, such as census             
    tracts, contain limited subject-matter detail (for example, counts of       
    people by age ranges--under 5 years, 5 to 9 years, etc.--rather than        
    by single years).  Report series that include greater amounts of            
    subject-matter detail include less geographic detail.                       
                                                                                
    COMPUTER TAPE FILES                                                         
                                                                                
    The Census Bureau provides more data on tape and other                      
    machine-readable products than in printed reports.  These products          
    are sold by the Census Bureau's Customer Services.  There are several       
    general types of data files released on computer tape (available on         
    both reels and cartridges).  They are introduced below, and more            
    information is presented in figures 5 and 6, pages F-12 through F-14.       
                                                                                
    PUBLIC LAW 94-171 DATE--This data file presents the counts designed         
    and formatted for use in legislative redistricting.  These counts           
    also are available on CD-ROM and paper listings.  Excerpts are              
    available on CENDATA (TM).  The counts, for areas as small as blocks,       
    census tracts, and voting districts, include totals for population,         
    race groups, persons of Hispanic origin, population 18 years and            
    over, and housing units.  (See figure 6.)                                   
                                                                                
    SUMMARY TAPE FILES (STF'S)--These computer tape files provide               
    statistics with greater subject-matter detail than printed reports.         
    They also present statistics for some types of areas, such as block         
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                               
                                                                                
      ICPSR 9952                                          Page 309              
                                                                                
                                                                                
    groups and blocks, that are not included in the reports.  (See figure       
    5.)                                                                         
                                                                                
    Here are some important features of STF's:                                  
                                                                                
        -   Each STF presents a particular set of data tables for specific      
            types of geographic areas.                                          
                                                                                
        -   Each STF has three or more file types (indicated by a letter        
            suffix attached to the STF number) that differ in the               
            geographic levels reported, but contain the same data detail.       
                                                                                
        -   STF's 1 and 2 contain 100-percent data, and STF's 3 and 4 offer     
            sample data.                                                        
                                                                                
        -   STF's 1 and 3 report on smaller areas and offer less data           
            detail than STF's 2 and 4.                                          
                                                                                
        -   STF's 1 through 4 offer greater data detail than the 1980 STF's     
            1 through 4.                                                        
                                                                                
    SUBJECT SUMMARY TAPE FILES (SSTF'S)--These files are the source of          
    the subject reports and provide greater subject-matter detail than          
    the STF'S.  They present data for the United States, regions, and           
    divisions, and, in some cases, also for States, counties, and large         
    cities.  (See figure 6.)                                                    
                                                                                
    PUBLIC USE MICRODATA SAMPLE (PUMS) FILES--These computer tape files         
    (see figure 6) contain data from samples of long-form housing-unit          
    records ("microdata") for large geographic areas.  Each sample              
    housing-unit record includes essentially all the 1990 census data           
    collected about each person in a sample household and the                   
    characteristics of the housing unit.  Information that could be used        
    to identify an individual or a housing unit is not included in the          
    file.                                                                       
                                                                                
    Microdata files enable users to prepare customized tabulations and          
    cross-tabulations of most items on the census questionnaire.  There         
    are two PUMS files:                                                         
                                                                                
        -   A file presenting a 5-percent sample of housing units in which      
            each household record includes codes to let the user know in        
            what area, such as a group of counties, a single county, or a       
            place, the household is located.  Each area identified must         
            have a population of at least 100,000 and boundaries that do        
            not cross State lines.                                              
                                                                                
        -   A file presenting a 1-percent sample of housing units.  Its         
            household records include codes associating them with MA's          
            and other large areas, the boundaries of which may cross            
            State lines.  (For the 1980 census, there were two files with

            1-percent samples.  The 1-percent sample showing data for           
            selected urbanized areas and other large areas will not be          
            produced for the 1990 census.)                                      
                                                                                
    OTHER SPECIAL COMPUTER TAPE FILES--Other files include the                  
    Census/Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Special File and the              
    County-to-County Migration File.  (See figure 6.)  The Census Bureau        
    may prepare additional special files.                                       
                                                                                
    MICROFICHE                                                                  
                                                                                
    Block statistics are available on microfiche as they were for the           
    1980 census, The microfiche present, in table format, a subset of the       
    tabulations for census blocks found in STF 1B (see figure 5).  In the       
    1990 census, for the first time, the entire land area of the Nation         
    and its possessions was block-numbered.  This increased the number of       
    blocks for which the Census Bureau provides data from 2.5 million in        
    1980 to 7 million for 1990.  The cost and storage of block data of          
    this magnitude would be prohibitive if the data were published in           
    printed reports.                                                            
                                                                                
    STF's 1A and 3A are available on microfiche, as well.  As noted in          
    figure 5, they provide data for a variety of geographic areas.  Also,       
    all printed reports are offered on microfiche from Customer Services        
    soon after they are published.

    The cost of preparing custom products must be paid by the users who         
    request them. Any data that the Census Bureau provides in these             
    products are subject to the same standards applied to other data to         
    ensure that confidential individual information is not revealed.            
                                                                                
    USER-DEFINED AREAS PROGRAM (UDAP) TABULATIONS--UDAP can provide a set       
    of predefined data tables for locally defined areas that do not             
    correspond to standard 1990 census geographic areas.  Users identify        
    the geographic areas of interest to them by delineating boundaries          
    around groupings of census blocks on 1990 census County Block Maps or       
    by electronically submitting the geographic components of their area        
    of interest.  (A contact for more information is given in the               
    "Sources of Assistance" section.)                                           
                                                                                
    SPECIAL TABULATIONS--The Census Bureau can prepare special data             
    tabulations for any specific geographic or subject-matter area.             
    Users should rely on standard reports, tapes, microfiche, or                
    user-defined area tabulations whenever possible, since special              
    tabulations tend to be substantially more expensive and take time to        
    arrange and produce.  (Contacts for more information are given in the       
    "Sources of Assistance" section.)

    Census Bureau maps are necessary for virtually all uses of small-area       
    1990 census data.  They are needed to locate the specific geographic        
    areas for which the census provides data and to study the spatial           
    relationship of the data for analytic purposes.  The Census Bureau          
    prepares a variety of 1990 census maps.  Among the most useful are          
    these four series:                                                          
                                                                                
    COUNTY BLOCK MAPS--These maps show census blocks and their numbers;         
    boundaries for statistical and governmental entities, such as census        
    tracts and places; and physical features.  The P.L.  94-171 version         
    of these maps also shows voting district boundaries in those States         
    that furnished them.  The maps are prepared on electrostatic plotters       
    by county (or equivalent entity) with one or more map sheets each,          
    depending on the size and shape of the area and the density of the          
    block pattern.  An average county requires 20 map sheets.  The maps         
    may be purchased from Customer Services.                                    
                                                                                
    COUNTY SUBDIVISION OUTLINE MAPS--Maps in this State-based series            
    present the boundaries of the counties, county subdivisions, places,        
    American Indian and Alaska Native areas (including off-reservation          
    trust lands), tribal designated statistical areas, and tribal               
    jurisdiction statistical areas.  Electrostatic-plotter copies are           
    available for purchase from Customer Services.  Also, they appear on        
    multiple page-size sheets in the State reports of these series: 1990        
    CPH-1, 1990 CPH-2, 1990 CPH-5, 1990 CP-1, 1990 CP-2, 1990 CH-1, and

    CENSUS TRACT/BLOCK NUMBERING AREA (BNA) OUTLINE MAPS--Maps in this          
    county-based series depict census tract or BNA boundaries and               
    numbers, and the features underlying the boundaries.  They also show        
    governmental units in relation to the census tracts/BNA's.  Customer        
    Services sells electrostatic-plotter copies, and the Superintendent         
    of Documents sells printed copies.                                          
                                                                                
    VOTING DISTRICT OUTLINE MAPS--Maps in this county-based series depict       
    voting district boundaries (for those counties for which States             
    furnished boundary information) and the features underlying the             
    boundaries.  They also show governmental unit boundaries in relation        
    to the voting districts.  They are prepared on electrostatic plotters       
    and sold by Customer Services.

    The Geographic Identification Code Scheme report in the 1990 CPH-R          
    series shows the 1990 census geographic area codes and Federal              
    information processing standards (FIPS) codes, as appropriate, for          
    States, metropolitan areas, counties, county subdivisions, places,          
    American Indian and Alaska Native areas, and other entities, along          
    with some descriptive information about the codes.  The code scheme         
    also is offered on computer tape.

    All 1990 census summary tape files include 1990 census geographic           
    area codes, FIPS codes, certain area names, land and inland water           
    area in square kilometers, geographic coordinates for an internal           
    point for each entity, and other geographic information.                    
                                                                                
    The Census Bureau developed an automated geographic data base, known        
    as the TIGER (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and              
    Referencing) System, to produce the geographic products for the 1990        
    census.  TIGER provides coordinate-based digital map information for        
    the entire United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S.  Virgin Islands, and        
    the Pacific territories over which the United States has                    
    jurisdiction.                                                               
                                                                                
    The TIGER System has significantly improved the utility of 1990             
    census maps and geographic reference products.  Extract files               
    generated from the TIGER System permit users, with appropriate              
    software, to perform such tasks as linking the statistical data in          
    the P.L.  94-171 file or the STF's and displaying selected                  
    characteristics on maps or a video display screen at different scales       
    and with whatever boundaries they select for any geographic area of         
    the country.  For example, a map for a particular county could show         
    the distribution of the voting age population by city block.

    The first extract of selected geographic and cartographic information       
    intended for computer applications, such as plotting maps and               
    building geographic information systems, is called the TIGER/Line           
    (TM) files.  TIGER/Line (TM) files contain attributes for the               
    segments of each boundary and feature (for example, roads, railroads.       
    and rivers), including 1990 census geographic codes for adjacent            
    areas, latitude/longitude coordinates of segment end points and the         
    curvature of segments, the name and type of the feature, and the            
    relevant census feature class code identifying the feature segment by       
    category.  TIGER/Line (TM) files also furnish address ranges and            
    associated ZIP Codes for each side of street segments in major urban        
    areas; provide the names of landmarks.  such as lakes and golf              
    courses; and include other information.                                     
                                                                                
    TIGER/Line (TM) files and other TIGER System extracts, such as              
    TIGER/Boundary (TM) and TIGER/DataBase (TM), are released on computer       
    tape and, in some cases, CD-ROM. For information on TIGER extract

    The other censuses, such as agriculture, retail trade, manufactures,        
    and governments, are collected for years ending in "2" and "7."             
    Surveys and estimates programs generate results as often as every           
    month.                                                                      
                                                                                
    Many of the monthly "economic indicators" that measure how the Nation       
    is doing come directly or indirectly from the Census Bureau.                
    Examples: employment and unemployment; housing starts; wholesale and        
    retail trade; manufacturers' shipments, inventories, and orders;            
    export and import trade; and sales of single-family homes.                  
                                                                                
    The other statistical activities of the Census Bureau are described         
    below.  Data users will find more information about them and                
    descriptions of their data products in the annual Census Catalog and        
    Guide.  Also, special guides and brochures are prepared for most of         
    them.  Contact the Census Bureau's Customer Services for more               
    information.                                                                
                                                                                
    CURRENT DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING PROGRAMS                                    
                                                                                
    Two types of current programs complement the 10-year census:                
    population estimates and surveys.  The total population of the United       
    States is estimated monthly; the population of States, counties, and        
    metropolitan areas is estimated annually; and the population of             
    places and other governmental units is estimated every 2 years.             
    Projections of future population are made at the national and State         
    levels.                                                                     
                                                                                
    The Census Bureau's many household surveys update population and            
    housing characteristics at the national level and sometimes for             
    States and metropolitan areas, as well.  These surveys also obtain          
    many characteristics not included in the 10-year census.  The Current       
    Population Survey is taken monthly; the American Housing Survey             
    national sample is taken biennially; the American Housing Survey            
    metropolitan sample is taken in 44 areas, 11 per year in a 4-year           
    cycle; most other surveys are annual or less frequent.                      
                                                                                
    ECONOMIC CENSUSES AND SURVEYS                                               
                                                                                
    The economic censuses provide statistics about business                     
    establishments once every 5 years, covering years ending in "2" and         
    "7."  The 1987 Economic Censuses include the censuses of retail             
    trade, wholesale trade, service industries, transportation,                 
    manufactures, mineral industries, and construction industries.  Also        
    included are related programs, such as statistics on minority and           
    women-owned businesses, enterprise statistics, and censuses of              
    economic activity in Puerto Rico and some of the outlying areas under       
    U.S.  jurisdiction.

    Several key statistics are tabulated for all industries covered in          
    the censuses.  They are number of establishments, number of                 
    employees, payroll, and measure of output (sales or receipts, and           
    value of shipments or of work done).  Other items vary from sector to       
    sector.                                                                     
                                                                                
    The Census Bureau also has programs that provide current statistics         
    on such measures as total sales of particular kinds of businesses or        
    production of particular products.  These programs include monthly,         
    quarterly, and annual surveys, the results of which appear in               
    publication series such as Current Business Reports and Current             
    Industrial Reports.  The County Business Patterns program offers            
    annual statistics based on data compiled primarily from                     
    administrative records.                                                     
                                                                                
    AGRICULTURE CENSUS AND SURVEYS                                              
                                                                                
    The agriculture census is conducted concurrently with the economic          
    censuses.  It is the only source of uniform agriculture data at the         
    county level.  It provides data on such subjects as the number and          
    size of farms; land use and ownership; livestock, poultry, and crops;       
    and value of products sold.                                                 
                                                                                
    Results of three surveys-the 1988 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey,         
    1988 Census of Horticulture Specialties, and 1988 Agricultural              
    Economics and Land Ownership Survey-are published in conjunction with       
    the 1987 Census of Agriculture.  Also, the Census Bureau regularly          
    issues reports from a survey on cotton ginnings.                            
                                                                                
    GOVERNMENTS CENSUS AND SURVEYS                                              
                                                                                
    The census of governments, also for years ending in "2" and "7,"            
    covers all types of governments: Federal, State, county, municipal          
    (place), township (county subdivision), school district, and special        
    district.  It provides data on such subjects as number of public            
    employees, payrolls, revenue, and expenditures.                             
                                                                                
    Annual and quarterly surveys cover the same principal subjects but          
    generate data only for States and the largest local governments.            
                                                                                
    FOREIGN TRADE STATISTICS                                                    
                                                                                
    Monthly U.S.  merchandise trade data compiled by the Census Bureau          
    summarize export and import transactions and are based on the               
    official documents filed by shippers and receivers.  These figures          
    reflect the flow of merchandise but not intangibles like services and       
    financial commitments.  The trade figures trace commodity movements         
    out of and into the U.S.  Customs jurisdiction, which includes Puerto       
    Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands as well as the 50 States and the          
    District of Columbia. Data are published separately on trade between        
    the United States and Puerto Rico, the U.S.  Virgin Islands, and

    The Census Bureau also offers international data.  It maintains an          
    international data base which is available to the public on computer        
    tape and is used to produce the biennial World Population Profile           
    report.  It prepares studies dealing with the demographic and               
    economic characteristics of other countries and world regions.              
                                                                                
    Statistical compendia are another important data product.  These            
    publications (sometimes also offered in machine-readable form) draw         
    data from many sources and reorganize them for convenient use.  The         
    most widely used compendia are the annual Statistical Abstract of the

    These are the maps which show the PUMAs for the 5% and 1% PUMS files.       
    These maps are for user convenience. The detailed components of the         
    Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) are presented in the equivalency         
    files which accompanied your tapes.                                         
                                                                                
    NOTE: There will be three PUMS files for the U.S.: 5%, 1% and 3%.           
    PUMS files are available on a state-by-state basis for the 5%, 1%           
    and 3% samples. There is no national file per se available from the         
    Census Bureau.  A user must acquire (use) all of the respective state       
    files (or have a third party draw extracts from them) to get a              
    national sample. Because of budgetary restraints, the 1/1000 extract        
    products were not produced for 1990.                                        
                                                                                
    The records from each state's 1% file where the PUMAs crossed               
    statelines appear on the state "99" file which will accompany all 1%        
    file orders. Users of the 1% file can locate records of choice by           
    searching under the appropriate MSA/PMSA codes.                             
                                                                                
    ICPSR NOTE: The list of the components of the "99" file PUMAs, provided     
    here, can also be found at the end of the Geographic Equivalency File       
    for the PUMS 1% data. The maps may be ordered hard copy only from ICPSR,    
    although in the future they may be available in machine-readable form.

    These appendixes, unless otherwise specified, are applicable to all         
    1990 Census Products based on sample data. In some instances you may        
    see a range of codes in a list. In most cases, these code ranges are        
    provided for ease of programming, and to provide detailed                   
    descriptions of the codes, and do not mean that all the values in the       
    range will appear in a given PUMS file. The valid codes for the PUMS        
    files are in Chapter 5. Please refer to that chapter when writing           
    your tabulation code.

            This section contains a modified code list for ancestry             
    categories for the PUMS.  Some categories have been grouped.  Each          
    person enumerated in the census had the opportunity to enter two            
    distinct ancestry identities which indicated his or her ethnic              
    origin.  Each entry received one of the unique three-digit codes            
    listed below.  All codes are listed below.  However, not all ancestry       
    entries are listed.  The ancestry codes can be aggregated to create         
    commonly recognized national groupings.  For example, the code for          
    Walloon has been collapsed with other "Belgian" entries to form a           
    national grouping representative of an area in Europe.  National            
    groupings can also be collapsed to represent continental areas.  For        
    example, Belgium can be added to France and other European clusters         
    to form a representation of that continent.  "n.e.c." is the                
    abbreviation for not elsewhere classified.

            This section contains the alphabetical code list for group          
    quarters. The group quarters code list was used by special place            
    prelist enumerators to classify each type of group quarters. Each           
    group quarters code is a two-digit number followed by either an "I"         
    (institutional) or "N" (noninstitutional) suffix. The group quarters        
    codes listed in the second column are for staff residing in group           
    quarters.

            This section contains the code list of languages other than         
    English spoken at home. Each entry was given a three-digit code. If         
    more than one language was reported, only the first language reported       
    was coded. The languages were coded originally into nearly 400              
    different language categories. The following list contains the              
    principal name for each code. Since many languages and language             
    groups are known by several names, additional illustrative names are        
    shown for some languages. A complete list of all reported language          
    names and categories into which they were coded may be obtained from        
    the Census Bureau at the cost of reproduction.

            The list presents the occupational classification developed         
    for the 1990 Census of Population and Housing. There are 500                
    categories for the employed with 1 additional category for the              
    experienced unemployed and 3 additional categories for the Armed            
    Forces. These categories are grouped into 6 summary groups and 13           
    major groups. The classification is developed from the 1980 Standard        
    Occupational Classification. "n.e.c." is the abbreviation for not           
    elsewhere classified.                                                       
            In the Table (Matrix) Outlines and the Table (Matrix)               
    Section, many occupation codes are presented as ranges; for example,        
    legislators (001-003).  In this appendix, the Occupation Code List          
    includes single census occupation codes and comparable Standard             
    Occupational Classification (SOC) code equivalents.  Single census          
    occupation codes in this appendix are equivalent to corresponding           
    census code ranges in the Table (Matrix) Outlines and Table (Matrix)        
    Section.

            This section contains the code list for place of birth. An          
    alphabetical list of U.S. States and territories, foreign countries,        
    and other areas was used to assign a three-digit code to the                
    birthplace reported by each person. The alphabetical list used in           
    coding included abbreviations and alternate names, including some           
    historical names for countries and names of States, provinces,              
    counties, or other subdivisions of countries.                               
                                                                                
            The following list does not include any of these alternate          
    names, but does include continent and area names used as defaults if        
    a specific country was not named but a broader region or area of            
    birth was reported. The names for foreign countries shown on this           
    list and in the publications reflect the most commonly used names in        
    this country, not their official or legal names. Each entry shown on        
    the following list has a unique code.                                       
                                                                                
            The U.S. States and territories were assigned their Federal         
    Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code preceded by a zero. For        
    foreign countries, codes were generally assigned by listing the             
    countries or areas in alphabetical order (followed by default               
    codes) within eight broad continent or regional areas: (1) Europe,          
    (2) Asia, (3) North America, (4) Central America, (5) Caribbean, (6)        
    South America, (7) Africa, and (8) Oceania. The entries for the USSR        
    and the Baltic States are listed following the other entries for            
    Europe for convenience in combining with either Europe or Asia. The         
    entries for Germany also do not follow strict alphabetical order;           
    codes 110-114 can be combined to tabulate an overall figure                 
    including Germany (not specified), East Germany, West Germany, and          
    Berlin. The entries for the United Kingdom also do not follow strict        
    alphabetical order; codes 138-145 can be combined to tabulate an            
    overall figure including United Kingdom (not specified), England,           
    Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of        
    Man. The codes for Asia also include a code for Korea (not specified)       
    since it is often reported in that fashion.

            This section contains the alphabetical code list for race and       
    American Indian tribes. The list of race groups and American Indian         
    tribes with their associated 3-digit numerical code was used to code        
    the Asian or Pacific Islander, American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut, and       
    the Other race write-in entries. A separate set of 3-digit numerical        
    codes were used to identify FOSDIC circles for the race categories          
    listed in the race item on the questionnaire.  These codes and their        
    respective race categories are: White-971, Black or Negro-972, Indian       
    (Amer.)-973, Eskimo-974, Aleut-975, Chinese-976, Filipino-977,
